# Synchronism Governance System Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Synchronism self-governing repository management system.

## Contents

1. [Synchronism Model Overview](./01_Synchronism_Model_Overview.md)
2. [Governance System Goals](./02_Governance_System_Goals.md)
3. [Architectural Overview](./03_Architectural_Overview.md)
4. [Module Documentation](./04_Module_Documentation.md)
5. [Configuration Files](./05_Configuration_Files.md)

## Purpose

This documentation provides a complete reference for understanding the autonomous governance system implemented for the Synchronism repository. It covers the philosophical foundations of the Synchronism model, the goals and design principles of the governance system, detailed descriptions of each module and configuration file, and how they work together to create a fully autonomous evolving model.

## Web4 R6 Framework Implementation

The Synchronism governance system is a practical implementation of the **R6 Action Framework** from Web4, demonstrating how digital actions can be transparent, purposeful, and accountable. Every governance cycle follows the R6 pattern:

**Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource â†’ Result**

### R6 Components in Synchronism Governance

- **Rules**: Governance protocols and phase constraints channel energy toward productive outcomes without constraining creativity
- **Role**: LCT-based identity system provides contextual permissions that shift across governance phases (proposer â†’ reviewer â†’ arbiter)
- **Request**: Proposals explicitly capture intent with rationale, acceptance criteria, and quality thresholds
- **Reference**: Participant history, trust scores, and cycle memory serve as active participants in decision-making
- **Resource**: API tokens, compute cycles, and focused attention are invested to create measurable value
- **Result**: Outcomes drive evolution through trust score updates, learning loops, and whitepaper rebuilds

This implementation proves Web4's vision that **intent can become reality** through structured, transparent processes where every action is accountable and purposeful.
