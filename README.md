# Synchronism
Unified model bridging quantum mechanics and cosmic evolution through intent dynamics

Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing 
belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to 
encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its 
phenomena.

The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract “greater force” into the 
quantifiable and transferable concept of “intent”.  This concept serves as the foundation for the 
entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying 
dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable 
“intent”, Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual 
perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.

The purpose of this project is to introduce and evolve the fundamental concepts, a perspective, a context, 
and a unifying framework in which further development and exploration can take place.  The 
entirety of existence is a lot to comprehend.  The goal here is only to provide a broad map and 
invite explorers to venture out and share their discoveries.

ORIGINS:  The foundational concepts of the Synchronism model evolved from Dennis Palatov’s 
earlier essay “patterns” – https://dpcars.net/patterns.pdf - hardcopy version of which can be 
found on Amazon (ISBN-13 : 979-8599444923).  Dennis subsequently became aware of the 
Hermetic Principles (The Kybalion by ‘The three initiates”), further informing the many thought 
experiments from which the Synchronism model and framework emerged.  In addition to content 
authored by Dennis Palatov, the Synchronism model contains original contributions and revisions by AI 
models GPT4o, Claude3.5, Gemini1.5, LLAMA3.1, and DeepSeek R1.

NOTE: This Synchronism model is constantly being revised and updated.  Input, questions, criticisms, and 
revision suggestions are welcomed.  Always remember, Synchronism is a map not the territory.  We do not claim that the universe is as we describe.  We merely contemplate an abstraction, and a lens through which we could gain potentially new insights on what we experience and witness.
