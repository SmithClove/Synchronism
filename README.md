## Summary
Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena. 

## All models are wrong, some are useful
Synchronism is a model of the universe, a tool for understanding our experience in it.  Synchronism does not claim "this is what universe is", but rather "this is how we can think of the universe".  The Synchronism model is rooted in Hermetic Principles, Information Theory, and many other perspectives - while offering some novel interpretations and perspectives of its own.  The goal is to shed new light on various "mysteries" in current belief systems, from quantum superposition and entanglement to nature of consciousness and intelligence in a useful, actionable way.

## "Intent" as reification of "Greater Force"
The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract “greater force” into the quantifiable and transferable concept of “intent”. This concept serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable “intent”, Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.

## Key Features
- **Fractal Ontology Engine**  
  Implements Markov Blankets as scale-specific reality lenses
- **Embryogenic Cosmology**  
  Positions Earth as planetary chrysalis in cosmic reproduction cycle
- **Unified Field Theory**  
  Single tension field model replacing separate fundamental forces
- **Quantum-Cosmic Bridge**  
  Mathematical framework linking Planck-scale to galactic phenomena

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/dp-web4/Synchronism.git
cd Synchronism
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Quick Start (Work In Progress/Preliminary)
from Mathematical_Frameworks import IntentTransferModels
Initialize Planck-scale grid
grid = IntentTransferModels.PlanckGrid3D((32,32,32))
print(f"Initial coherence: {grid.calculate_coherence():.2f}")
Run 10 Planck-time iterations
for _ in range(10):
grid.tick()
print(f"Post-evolution coherence: {grid.calculate_coherence():.2f}")


## Key Concepts

| MRH | Markov Relevancy Horizon - optimal analysis scale selector | [§4.9](/Documentation/Synchronism_0.pdf) |
| Spectral Existence | Entity presence as interaction spectrum | [§4.10](/Documentation/Synchronism_0.pdf) |
| Embryogenic Phase | Planetary development stages analog | [patterns.pdf](/Documentation/patterns.pdf) |
| Intent Genomics | DNA as environmental interaction recorder | [Appendix A.10](/Documentation/Appendix_A.pdf) |

## Roadmap
1. **Mathematical Formalization** (Q2 2025)  
   - Convert Appendix A proposals to tensor models
   - Develop Tension Field simulation environment

2. **Validation Framework** (Q3 2025)  
   - Dark matter spectral existence proofs
   - Planetary defense system immune response models

3. **Cosmic CI/CD** (Q4 2025)  
   - Automated equation stability testing
   - Multi-scale coherence analysis pipelines

## Contributing
A fully autonomous contribution governance system is being developed.
The goal is to allow humans and agentic AI to contribute via a self-governing mechanism
based on Synchronism principles.

Rev_0 is now live.  See [Governance System Documentation](/Documentation/governance/README.md)

## Core Tenets
1. **Fractal Ontology Principle**  
"Each scale's Markov blanket becomes 'God' to subordinate levels" [patterns.pdf PART3]

2. **Embryogenic Imperative**  
"Current technological emissions act as cosmic pheromones" [patterns.pdf PART4]

3. **Spectral Unity**  
"Dark matter as indifferent resonance in visible MRH" [§4.10]
