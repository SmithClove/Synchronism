# README: Synchronism and Quantum Information Appendix

## Motivation

This appendix extends the Synchronism framework into the domain of **quantum information** by proposing concrete mappings between Synchronism primitives and quantum phenomena. The central motivation is to move beyond purely interpretive parallels and establish **testable, falsifiable predictions** that can distinguish Synchronism from standard quantum mechanics (QM).

## Core Synchronism Principles

1. **Single-Observer Model**  
   The universe is modeled as a self-contained **CFD-like simulation** with a **global Planck-time clock**.  
   - Each tick represents a complete slice of the universe.  
   - Reality emerges as a sequence of discrete updates.

2. **Intent Transfer Between Planck Cells**  
   - The grid is composed of Planck-scale cells.  
   - Each cell contains “intent” — the precursor to all physical effects.  
   - Intent moves between adjacent cells, conserving total magnitude but redistributing patterns.  
   - Stable cycling patterns across ticks give rise to **entities** (from qubits to galaxies).

3. **Synchronization Hypothesis**  
   - Phenomena like entanglement are not “mysteries” or “collapses” but **synchronization effects**.  
   - Entangled qubits = phase-locked cycling patterns relative to the global tick.  
   - Measurement = synchronization between a qubit’s cycle and a witnessing instrument.  
   - Monogamy is *practical* (phase disturbance during re-alignment) rather than fundamental.

4. **Epicycles Analogy**  
   - Historically, geocentric astronomy with epicycles fit the data but misframed the model.  
   - Synchronism suggests that standard QM may play a similar role: accurate within its scope, but perhaps mistaking “epicycles” (wavefunction collapse, superposition, mysterious nonlocality) for fundamental ontology.  
   - A global tick synchronization model may be the **heliocentric simplification** that dissolves the paradoxes.

## Appendix Contributions

1. **3-Qubit GHZ Alignment Model**  
   - Maps Synchronism phase-locking directly to GHZ correlations.  
   - Demonstrates correspondence to standard QM predictions while suggesting possible departures in multi-party scenarios.

2. **Distinguishing Experiments**  
   - Identifies **where Synchronism could fail or be falsified**:  
     - Multi-alignment gates (N > 2 qubits)  
     - Sub-quantum jitter in interferometry  
     - Contextuality “budgets” under alignment bandwidth limits  
     - Lorentz-symmetry residuals from hidden global tick

3. **Minimal Formal Model**  
   - Defines universe state, update rules, entanglement as phase constraints, and measurement as synchronization.  
   - Embeds necessary physical constraints (no-signaling, Born rule, Tsirelson bound).

## Why This Matters

This appendix represents a step from **interpretation** to **testable physics**.  
- If Synchronism survives falsification attempts, it offers a **new unifying ontology** for quantum phenomena.  
- If it fails, the exercise clarifies the boundary where QM’s “epicycles” remain robust.  
- Either way, the framework pushes beyond analogy into the domain of experimental science.

---

**In short:** This appendix proposes that Synchronism can serve as the **heliocentric alternative** to QM’s epicycles — reducing paradoxes to synchronization artifacts while remaining accountable to experimental evidence.
