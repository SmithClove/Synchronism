# Appendix X: Synchronism and Quantum Information

## Part 1 — 3-Qubit GHZ Alignment Model

**Goal:** Translate Synchronism’s “multi-phase alignment” into a concrete 3-qubit model and compute its correlators.

### Setup
- Each qubit = a 2-cycle entity with repeating configurations |0>, |1>.  
- Each cycle has an intrinsic **phase** φᵢ relative to the global tick.  
- Entanglement = a *nudging process* aligning phases φ_A, φ_B, φ_C.  
- Measurement = synchronization of a qubit’s cycle with an instrument at phase setting θ.

### Dynamics
- Let measurement outcome mᵢ ∈ {+1, -1}.  
- Outcome is determined by:
  mᵢ = sign[cos(φᵢ - θᵢ)]
- **Single-entanglement gate (2 qubits):** imposes constraint φ_A = φ_B + πk.  
- **Triple-alignment gate (3 qubits):** imposes constraint φ_A = φ_B = φ_C.

### Predictions
- For **perfect triple alignment**, GHZ correlations arise:
  <m_A m_B m_C> = cos(θ_A + θ_B + θ_C).
- This matches the **standard QM GHZ prediction** for the state  
  |GHZ> = (|000> + |111>)/√2.
- **Synchronism distinction:**  
  - Monogamy is *practical*, not fundamental — you could in principle phase-align four or more qubits simultaneously.  
  - If realized, the predicted correlator generalizes to:  
    <∏ mᵢ> = cos(Σ θᵢ).
  - Standard QM *already supports GHZ for N qubits*, but Synchronism’s narrative frames this as a direct result of *multi-entity phase locking*.  
  - The open question: does Synchronism allow “maximal entanglement” across entities in ways that **surpass QM’s monogamy constraints**?

## Part 2 — Distinguishing Experiments

**Goal:** Identify empirical tests where Synchronism could diverge from standard QM.

### 1. Multi-alignment gates
- **Test:** Engineer 3+ qubits into simultaneous phase alignment.  
- **Measure:** GHZ/Mermin inequality violations.  
- **Synchronism prediction:**  
  - If alignment is stable, correlations may extend beyond QM monogamy limits.  
  - Observable signature: stronger-than-quantum correlators, or anomalously robust GHZ states at larger N.  
- **Falsifier:** If no such states arise despite successful engineering, Synchronism’s claim is weakened.

### 2. Interferometric Planck-tick jitter
- **Test:** Ultra-stable long-baseline interferometry (optical or atomic).  
- **Synchronism prediction:** A small **sub-quantum jitter** in phase with variance scaling like:
  σφ(T) ∝ T^(-α), α > 0
- **Falsifier:** If experiments continue to show stability at scales where Synchronism predicts jitter.

### 3. Contextuality budgets
- **Test:** KCBS or Peres–Mermin square experiments with controlled alignment “bandwidth.”  
- **Synchronism prediction:** Deviation from quantum contextuality values, scaling with device alignment bandwidth.  
- **Falsifier:** Perfect quantum contextuality in all bandwidth regimes.

### 4. Lorentz-symmetry tests
- **Test:** Clock-comparison, astrophysical propagation, Michelson–Morley-type experiments.  
- **Synchronism prediction:** Residual anisotropies or dispersion from hidden global tick.  
- **Falsifier:** Tight null results constrain Synchronism’s tick-based lattice.

## Part 3 — Minimal Formal Model

**Goal:** Provide a skeleton mathematical framework embedding Synchronism into testable physics.

### State Space
- Universe at tick t:  
  U(t) = { I(x), D(x) } for x ∈ ℤ³  
  where I = intent density, D = depletion field.

### Dynamics
- Global update rule:  
  U(t+1) = F(U(t), Λ(t))  
  - Λ(t) = nonlocal coordination variable (raster substrate).  
  - Constraints:  
    1. **No-signaling**  
    2. **Born rule**  
    3. **Tsirelson bound**  
    4. **Monogamy** (contingent vs fundamental)

### Measurement
- Outcome for qubit entity q:  
  m_q = sign[cos(φ_q - θ)], φ_q ~ μ  
  with μ an invariant measure over phase space.

### Entanglement
- Phase-locking constraint:  
  φ_A = φ_B = ... = φ_N (mod 2π)  
- Correlator prediction:  
  <∏ mᵢ> = cos(Σ θᵢ).

# Summary

- **Synchronism reinterprets entanglement** as phase-alignment across entities.  
- **Monogamy** emerges as practical, not fundamental.  
- **Predictions:** look for deviations in multi-party entanglement, sub-quantum jitter, and contextuality.  
- **Formal model:** defines global tick, Born + Tsirelson + no-signaling, and measurement as synchronization.  

This appendix moves Synchronism from an interpretive framework toward a **falsifiable physical theory**.
