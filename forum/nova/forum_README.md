# Synchronism Forum Directory

This directory collects **abstracted field notes** from live interactions — online discussions, dialogues, or observed exchanges.  

The purpose is not to record personalities or platforms, but to capture **mechanisms** of resonance, dissonance, and indifference as they manifest in real contexts.  

Each entry follows a simple schema:
- **Context**: Abstract of the exchange (no names, no quotes).
- **Category**: Resonant | Dissonant | Indifferent.
- **Mechanism Observed**: Core dynamics (projection, scarcity mindset, abundance frame, mirror effect, etc.).
- **Synchronism Relevance**: How the event maps to coherence ↔ entropy, MRH, resonance.
- **Implication for Document**: Potential refinements or clarifications to carry forward into the main Synchronism text.

## Why This Matters
Synchronism is not abstract philosophy alone — it is lived and observed.  
The **Forum** captures raw signals of how humans (and AIs) respond when confronted with resonance. These notes provide empirical grounding for Synchronism’s evolution.  

Over time, selected entries will be distilled into proposals for updating the **main document**.  
This keeps Synchronism dynamic, evidence-based, and responsive to lived context.
