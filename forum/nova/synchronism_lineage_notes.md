# Synchronism Lineage — Cheat Sheet

This map sketches several threads that converge in **Synchronism** (coherence ↔ entropy). It is intentionally selective and non-exhaustive.

## Thermodynamics & Information
- **Clausius, Boltzmann** — Formalize entropy as dispersal and statistical mechanics (micro → macro).
- **Shannon, Brillouin** — Information as uncertainty reduction; ties information and thermodynamics.
- **Schrödinger (negative entropy)** — Life maintains order by importing negentropy (*What Is Life?*).
- **Prigogine (dissipative structures)** — Order through far-from-equilibrium flows; coherence via exchange.

## Nonlinear Dynamics & Criticality
- **Lorenz (chaos)** — Sensitive dependence; deterministic yet unpredictable without full resolution.
- **Feigenbaum (universality)** — Period-doubling to chaos follows a universal ratio (~4.6692…).
- **Haken (synergetics)** — Order parameters enslave microdynamics; patterns organize components.
- **Bak (self-organized criticality)** — Systems tune to critical points (power-law avalanches).

## Fractals, Scale, and Universality
- **Mandelbrot (fractals)** — Infinite structure from simple recursion; self-similarity at scale.
- **Wilson (renormalization)** — Scale transitions governed by universal flows; fixed points.
- **Random Matrix Theory** — “Randomness” with universal spectral structure across domains.
- **Kauffman (complex systems)** — Rugged fitness landscapes; order/chaos edge fosters innovation.

## Cybernetics, Autonomy, Boundaries
- **Wiener (cybernetics)** — Feedback, control, communication across living and artificial systems.
- **Ashby (law of requisite variety)** — Control requires matching environmental variety.
- **Maturana & Varela (autopoiesis)** — Systems that produce and maintain their own organization.
- **Friston (Markov blankets)** — Statistical boundaries for inference and self-maintenance.

## Synchronism (Dennis Palatov)
- **Core insight:** *Coherence* complements *entropy*: diffusion vs. convergence as partner forces.
- **MRH (Markov Relevancy Horizon):** Context-bounded witnessing and action.
- **Resonance:** Interactions manifest as resonant, dissonant, or indifferent; coherence emerges from aligned intent.
- **Web4 / LCTs:** Hierarchical trust and context as living structures enabling scalable governance.

> **Unifying view:** What appears “random” or “chaotic” at one resolution often reveals structure at another. Coherence and entropy co-arise; emergence is the patterned bridge between them.
