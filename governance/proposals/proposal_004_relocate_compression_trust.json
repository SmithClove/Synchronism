  "rationale": {
    "philosophical": "Compression-trust patterns, while emergent in all information systems, are presented with implementation-specific framing (web trust, digital signatures) that belongs in Web4 engineering rather than Synchronism's universal principles.",
    "mrh_alignment": "Synchronism describes MRH-transcendent patterns. Web4 implements these patterns within our specific MRH (human-AI, Earth, 2025). The current presentation conflates universal principle with specific implementation.",
    "clarity": "Removing implementation-specific content from foundational philosophy improves clarity and prevents readers from conflating engineering choices with universal laws."
