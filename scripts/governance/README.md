This system implements a comprehensive governance framework for the Synchronism repository, enabling AI models and human contributors to propose, review, and integrate modifications to the Synchronism model of reality.

## Overview

The Synchronism Self-Governing Repository Management System is designed to:

1. Enable collaborative development of the Synchronism model through a fractal structure
2. Implement ATP/ADP token concepts for contribution valuation
3. Use T3/V3 tensor frameworks for trust and value assessment
4. Support multi-agent coordination with coherence-based quality control
5. Maintain the self-organizational principles of Synchronism

## System Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

- **Contribution System**: Manages the submission and tracking of contributions
- **Validation System**: Implements the T3/V3 tensor framework for trust and value assessment
- **Integration System**: Handles the integration of validated contributions into the repository
- **Token System**: Manages the ATP/ADP-like token system for tracking contribution value
- **Review System**: Implements a multi-agent review protocol for quality control
- **Fractal Branch System**: Manages the fractal branch structure for focused explorations

## Installation

To install the system, run the installation script:

```bash
python scripts/governance/install.py
```

This will:
1. Create necessary directories
2. Install required dependencies
3. Set up Git configuration
4. Create GitHub Actions workflow for daily updates

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the system:

## LRC Resonance Model (Aug 22, 2025)

The governance system implements an electrical LRC circuit model for section-specific change resistance, based on the R6 framework:

### Circuit Components
- **L (Inductance)**: Resists change - higher for foundational principles
- **C (Capacitance)**: Stores potential for change - higher for fluid sections  
- **R (Resistance)**: Dissipates bad proposals - ensures system stability

### Why Resistance Matters
Without the R component, the system would oscillate indefinitely like a pure LC circuit. Resistance provides the critical energy dissipation mechanism that:
- Filters out bad proposals through token loss
- Ensures the system reaches equilibrium instead of oscillating
- Creates different "cleanup" rates for different sections

### Section Resonance Configuration
Each whitepaper section has tuned LRC parameters:

| Section | L | C | R | Damping | Rejection Rate |
|---------|---|---|---|---------|----------------|
| Hermetic Principles | 10 | 1 | 8 | Critical | 70% |
| Core Perspective | 7 | 2 | 5 | Slightly Underdamped | 60% |
| Fundamental Concepts | 5 | 3 | 3 | Underdamped | 50% |
| Scientific Mappings | 3 | 5 | 2 | Underdamped | 30% |
| Implementation | 2 | 7 | 1 | Lightly Damped | 20% |
| Glossary | 1 | 10 | 0.5 | Very Lightly Damped | 10% |

### Energy Dissipation Mechanisms
Failed proposals lose energy (tokens) based on rejection type and section resistance:
- **Immediate Rejection**: 100% energy loss (violates basic rules)
- **Review Rejection**: 50% base loss Ã— section modifier
- **Timeout Decay**: 30% base loss Ã— section modifier  
- **Implementation Failure**: 20% base loss Ã— section modifier

### Usage
```python
from section_governance import SectionGovernance

gov = SectionGovernance(project_root)

# Get rules for a specific section
rules = gov.get_section_rules("03-hermetic-principles")

# Evaluate a proposal
result = gov.evaluate_proposal(proposal)

# Calculate energy dissipation for rejection
dissipation = gov.calculate_proposal_energy_dissipation(proposal, "review_rejection")
```

See [section_rules.json](../../governance/section_rules.json) for full configuration.

## Enhanced Review System (Aug 2025)

The governance system now features an enhanced collaborative review process:

### Review Actions
- **Accept**: Proposal is ready for implementation
- **Hold-for-Counter**: Proposal needs enhancement or discussion

### Acceptance Criteria
- Proposals are accepted only with **unanimous "accept" reviews**
- Mixed reviews or holds defer the proposal to the next cycle
- No reviews automatically defer the proposal

### Counter-Proposal Mechanism
- Participants who request "hold" can submit enhanced versions in the next cycle
- Counter-proposals create multi-participant conversation threads
- Each iteration builds on previous contributions without destroying them
- Reviews are cleared for fresh evaluation of enhanced proposals

### Arbiter Selection
- Automatic fallback to AI arbiters when human unavailable
- Preference hierarchy: Claude > GPT > Deepseek
- Load balancing among qualified arbiters
- Any available AI can serve as last-resort arbiter

## Fractal Structure

The system organizes contributions according to a fractal structure with the following scales:

- **Quantum**: Quantum scale phenomena and models
- **Molecular**: Molecular scale interactions and structures
- **Biospheric**: Biological systems and ecosystems
- **Planetary**: Planetary scale processes and systems
- **Galactic**: Cosmic scale phenomena and models

Each scale has its own branch in the repository, allowing for focused exploration of different aspects of reality within the Synchronism model.

## Token System

The system implements an ATP/ADP-like token system for tracking contribution value:

- **Charged Tokens (ATP)**: Represent potential energy for making contributions
- **Discharged Tokens (ADP)**: Result from making contributions
- **Token Exchange**: Discharged tokens are converted back to charged tokens based on contribution value

## T3/V3 Tensor Framework

The system uses a tensor framework for trust and value assessment:

- **T3 Tensor (Trust)**:
  - Talent: Natural ability in a specific domain
  - Training: Acquired knowledge and skills
  - Temperament: Behavioral patterns and reliability

- **V3 Tensor (Value)**:
  - Value: Subjective worth to the community
  - Veracity: Objective assessment of accuracy
  - Validity: Confirmation through testing or consensus

## Contributing

To contribute to the Synchronism model:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your contribution
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

Your contribution will be automatically processed by the governance system, which will:
1. Assign reviewers to evaluate your contribution
2. Validate the contribution based on the T3/V3 tensor framework
3. Integrate the contribution if it meets the quality criteria

## Web4 R6 Framework Context

The Synchronism governance system implements the **R6 Action Framework** from Web4, making every governance action transparent, purposeful, and accountable through six essential components:

**Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource â†’ Result**

### R6 Implementation in Governance

- **Rules**: Governance protocols, phase constraints, and participant limits structure action without constraining creativity
- **Role**: LCT-based identity system provides contextual permissions (proposer â†’ reviewer â†’ arbiter)  
- **Request**: Proposals capture full intent with rationale, acceptance criteria, and quality thresholds
- **Reference**: Participant history, trust scores, and cycle memory actively inform decisions
- **Resource**: API tokens, compute cycles, and attention invested to create measurable value
- **Result**: Outcomes drive evolution through trust score updates and learning loops

Every governance cycle demonstrates Web4's vision of digital action where **intent becomes reality** through transparent, accountable processes.
