# Synchronism Self-Governing Repository Management System

This system implements a comprehensive governance framework for the Synchronism repository, enabling AI models and human contributors to propose, review, and integrate modifications to the Synchronism model of reality.

## Overview

The Synchronism Self-Governing Repository Management System is designed to:

1. Enable collaborative development of the Synchronism model through a fractal structure
2. Implement ATP/ADP token concepts for contribution valuation
3. Use T3/V3 tensor frameworks for trust and value assessment
4. Support multi-agent coordination with coherence-based quality control
5. Maintain the self-organizational principles of Synchronism

## System Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

- **Contribution System**: Manages the submission and tracking of contributions
- **Validation System**: Implements the T3/V3 tensor framework for trust and value assessment
- **Integration System**: Handles the integration of validated contributions into the repository
- **Token System**: Manages the ATP/ADP-like token system for tracking contribution value
- **Review System**: Implements a multi-agent review protocol for quality control
- **Fractal Branch System**: Manages the fractal branch structure for focused explorations

## Installation

To install the system, run the installation script:

```bash
python scripts/governance/install.py
```

This will:
1. Create necessary directories
2. Install required dependencies
3. Set up Git configuration
4. Create GitHub Actions workflow for daily updates

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the system:

```bash
python scripts/governance/main.py init
```

This will set up the initial state of the system, including:
1. Creating the fractal branch structure
2. Setting up initial token distribution

### Daily Updates

The system is designed to run daily updates automatically through GitHub Actions. To run an update manually:

```bash
python scripts/governance/main.py update
```

This will:
1. Process new contributions
2. Assign reviewers to pending contributions
3. Process reviews and determine consensus
4. Validate accepted contributions
5. Integrate validated contributions
6. Distribute tokens based on contribution value
7. Update the repository with changes

### Testing

To test the system:

```bash
python scripts/governance/test.py
```

This will run unit tests for all components of the system.

## Fractal Structure

The system organizes contributions according to a fractal structure with the following scales:

- **Quantum**: Quantum scale phenomena and models
- **Molecular**: Molecular scale interactions and structures
- **Biospheric**: Biological systems and ecosystems
- **Planetary**: Planetary scale processes and systems
- **Galactic**: Cosmic scale phenomena and models

Each scale has its own branch in the repository, allowing for focused exploration of different aspects of reality within the Synchronism model.

## Token System

The system implements an ATP/ADP-like token system for tracking contribution value:

- **Charged Tokens (ATP)**: Represent potential energy for making contributions
- **Discharged Tokens (ADP)**: Result from making contributions
- **Token Exchange**: Discharged tokens are converted back to charged tokens based on contribution value

## T3/V3 Tensor Framework

The system uses a tensor framework for trust and value assessment:

- **T3 Tensor (Trust)**:
  - Talent: Natural ability in a specific domain
  - Training: Acquired knowledge and skills
  - Temperament: Behavioral patterns and reliability

- **V3 Tensor (Value)**:
  - Value: Subjective worth to the community
  - Veracity: Objective assessment of accuracy
  - Validity: Confirmation through testing or consensus

## Contributing

To contribute to the Synchronism model:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your contribution
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request

Your contribution will be automatically processed by the governance system, which will:
1. Assign reviewers to evaluate your contribution
2. Validate the contribution based on the T3/V3 tensor framework
3. Integrate the contribution if it meets the quality criteria

## Web4 R6 Framework Context

The Synchronism governance system implements the **R6 Action Framework** from Web4, making every governance action transparent, purposeful, and accountable through six essential components:

**Rules + Role + Request + Reference + Resource â†’ Result**

### R6 Implementation in Governance

- **Rules**: Governance protocols, phase constraints, and participant limits structure action without constraining creativity
- **Role**: LCT-based identity system provides contextual permissions (proposer â†’ reviewer â†’ arbiter)  
- **Request**: Proposals capture full intent with rationale, acceptance criteria, and quality thresholds
- **Reference**: Participant history, trust scores, and cycle memory actively inform decisions
- **Resource**: API tokens, compute cycles, and attention invested to create measurable value
- **Result**: Outcomes drive evolution through trust score updates and learning loops

Every governance cycle demonstrates Web4's vision of digital action where **intent becomes reality** through transparent, accountable processes.
