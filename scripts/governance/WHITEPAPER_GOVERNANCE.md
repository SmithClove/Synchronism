# Whitepaper Living Document Governance System

## Overview

This system implements a comprehensive governance framework for the Synchronism whitepaper, enabling it to evolve as a living document through structured collaboration between human and AI participants.

## Architecture

### Meta File Structure

Each whitepaper section directory contains a `meta/` subdirectory with:

```
section-name/
├── content.md          # The actual section content (fractal file)
└── meta/
    ├── changelog.md              # Append-only change history
    ├── future-considerations.md  # Editable list of improvements to consider
    ├── proposals/                # Submitted proposals for changes
    │   ├── 001-title.md
    │   └── 002-title.md
    └── reviews/                  # Reviews of proposals
        ├── 001-review-gpt4.md
        └── 001-review-claude.md
```

### Key Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Participants modify only meta files, not fractal content files
2. **Transparency**: All proposals and reviews are visible
3. **Round-Robin Fairness**: AI participants take turns proposing improvements
4. **Human Arbitration**: Final decisions made by designated arbiters
5. **Token-Based Incentives**: Contributors earn governance tokens

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis & Proposal
- AI participants analyze sections for potential improvements
- Proposals created based on future-considerations.md
- Each proposal includes rationale and specific changes

### Phase 2: Peer Review
- Other AI participants review proposals
- Reviews include strengths, concerns, and suggestions
- Recommendations: ACCEPT, ACCEPT_WITH_REVISIONS, REVISE_AND_RESUBMIT, REJECT

### Phase 3: Arbitration
- Arbiter evaluates proposal and reviews
- Makes final decision on acceptance
- Only arbiter can modify fractal content files

### Phase 4: Implementation
- Accepted changes implemented in content files
- Changelog updated with modification record
- Future considerations updated to reflect completion

## API Components

### 1. `whitepaper_governance.py`
Core governance system managing proposals, reviews, and decisions.

```python
governance = WhitepaperGovernance()

# Create a proposal
proposal = governance.create_proposal(
    section_path="04-fundamental-concepts/01-universe-grid",
    author="Claude-3.5",
    title="Enhancement Title",
    proposal_type=ProposalType.EXPANSION,
    content="Detailed description",
    rationale="Why this matters",
    specific_changes="Exact text changes"
)

# Submit a review
review = governance.submit_review(
    section_path="...",
    proposal_id="001",
    reviewer="GPT-4",
    recommendation=ReviewRecommendation.ACCEPT_WITH_REVISIONS,
    strengths=["Point 1", "Point 2"],
    concerns=["Issue 1"],
    suggested_revisions={"Line 3": "Better wording"}
)
```

### 2. `ai_participant_api.py`
Interfaces for AI participants (Claude, GPT) to engage with governance.

```python
# Initialize participants
claude = ClaudeParticipant()
gpt = GPTParticipant()

# Analyze section
analysis = claude.analyze_section("section-path")

# Create proposal from analysis
proposal = claude.generate_proposal_from_analysis("section-path", analysis)

# Review proposal
recommendation, review_analysis = gpt.evaluate_proposal(proposal)
```

### 3. `arbiter_system.py`
Manages arbiter selection and decision-making.

```python
arbiter_system = GovernanceArbiterSystem()

# Process pending proposals
decisions = arbiter_system.process_pending_proposals()

# Implement accepted proposals
implemented = arbiter_system.implement_accepted_proposals("section-path")
```

## Governance Roles

### AI Participants
- **Claude**: Focus on conceptual clarity, philosophical coherence
- **GPT-4**: Focus on mathematical rigor, scientific accuracy
- **Deepseek**: Focus on implementation details, technical precision
- **Others**: Specialized perspectives as needed

### Arbiters
- **Human Arbiter**: Final authority, can override recommendations
- **AI Consensus**: Automated decisions based on review consensus
- **Token-Weighted**: Decisions influenced by governance token holdings

## Testing

Run the complete workflow test:
```bash
python scripts/governance/test_governance_workflow.py
```

This tests:
1. Proposal creation by Claude
2. Review submission by GPT
3. Counter-proposal by GPT
4. Cross-review by Claude
5. Arbiter decision-making
6. Status tracking and updates

## Current Status

### Implemented
✅ Meta file structure for sections
✅ Proposal submission system with LCT identity
✅ Review mechanism with exclusive hold rights
✅ Arbiter decision workflow with fallback
✅ Selective changelog for noteworthy changes only
✅ Automatic whitepaper rebuild on fractal changes
✅ API context with clear identity and role
✅ Test suite demonstrating full workflow

### Automatic Rebuild Process
When fractal files change at cycle completion:
1. Change detection via SHA256 hashing
2. Automatic rebuild of MD/PDF/Web versions
3. Build log maintained in `.governance/build_log.json`
4. Only triggered when actual content changes occur

### Next Steps
- [ ] API endpoints for remote AI participation
- [ ] Create whitepaper build scripts (make-markdown.sh, make-pdf.sh, make-web.sh)
- [ ] Token distribution based on accepted proposals
- [ ] Automated daily governance rounds
- [ ] Web interface for proposal tracking

## Example Proposal

```markdown
# Proposal 001: Grid Topology Enhancement

## Metadata
- **ID**: 001
- **Author**: Claude-3.5
- **Date**: 2025-08-19
- **Status**: Under Review
- **Type**: EXPANSION

## Proposed Change
Expand Universe Grid description to include non-Euclidean geometry
and fractal self-similarity at different scales.

## Rationale
Aligns with general relativity's curved spacetime and maintains
consistency with Synchronism's scale-based philosophy.

## Specific Text Changes
Add after paragraph 3:
> The grid's topology need not be purely Euclidean...
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

This whitepaper governance system is designed to work alongside the existing Rev_0 autonomous governance system, which manages:
- Fractal branch creation for explorations
- ATP/ADP token mechanics
- T3/V3 tensor trust assessments
- Multi-scale contributions

The whitepaper governance focuses specifically on document evolution while leveraging the broader governance infrastructure for tokens and trust metrics.
