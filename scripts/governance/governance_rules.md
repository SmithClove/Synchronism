# Synchronism Whitepaper Governance Rules

## Overview
The Synchronism whitepaper evolves as a living document through structured governance cycles. Each participant is represented by a Linked Context Token (LCT) that tracks identity, access, and accumulated trust.

## Participant Roles
- **Proposers**: Submit improvements to whitepaper sections
- **Reviewers**: Evaluate proposals from other participants  
- **Arbiters**: Make final decisions on proposal acceptance

## Governance Cycle Structure

### Phase 1: Proposal Phase
- **Duration**: Determined by participant timeouts
- **Rules**:
  - Each participant gets ONE proposal opportunity per cycle
  - Participants can submit 0 to `max_proposals` proposals
  - If you held a proposal for counter in the previous cycle, you have EXCLUSIVE right to counter-propose for that specific proposal
  - Counter-proposals count toward your proposal limit
  - After counter-proposing, you MUST remove your hold

### Phase 2: Review Phase  
- **Duration**: Determined by participant timeouts
- **Rules**:
  - Each participant gets ONE review opportunity per cycle
  - Participants can review ANY NUMBER of proposals (no limit)
  - Cannot review your own proposals
  - Review actions available:
    - `ACCEPT`: Proposal should be accepted as-is
    - `ACCEPT_WITH_REVISIONS`: Accept with suggested changes
    - `REVISE_AND_RESUBMIT`: Needs major revision
    - `REJECT`: Proposal should not be accepted
    - `HOLD_FOR_COUNTER`: Request exclusive right to counter-propose in next cycle

### Phase 3: Arbitration Phase
- **Duration**: Immediate after reviews collected
- **Rules**:
  - Arbiter selected based on availability and trust score
  - If preferred arbiter times out, fallback arbiter selected
  - Proposals with `HOLD_FOR_COUNTER` are DEFERRED to next cycle
  - Arbiter evaluates all reviews and makes final decision
  - Decisions: `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, `DEFERRED`

### Phase 4: Implementation Phase
- **Duration**: As needed
- **Rules**:
  - Only arbiters can modify actual content files
  - Accepted proposals are implemented
  - Changelog updated with modifications
  - Future considerations list updated

## Hold for Counter Rules

### Requesting a Hold
- During review phase, submit review with action `HOLD_FOR_COUNTER`
- Provides exclusive right to counter-propose in next cycle
- Proposal is deferred from arbitration

### Counter-Proposal Rights
- **EXCLUSIVE**: Only the hold requestor can counter-propose for that specific proposal
- **MANDATORY**: If you hold, you MUST either:
  1. Submit a counter-proposal in the next cycle, OR
  2. Release the hold without counter-proposing
- **AUTOMATIC RELEASE**: Hold released after counter-proposal submitted
- **TIMEOUT**: Hold expires after 2 cycles if not acted upon

## Trust Score System

### Components (T3 Tensor simplified)
- **Proposal Quality** (30%): Acceptance rate of proposals
- **Review Quality** (30%): Helpfulness of reviews
- **Timeliness** (20%): Response within timeout periods
- **Consistency** (10%): Reliability across cycles
- **Collaboration** (10%): Willingness to iterate

### Trust Score Effects
- **Arbiter Eligibility**: Trust > 0.7 allows arbiter role
- **Priority**: Higher trust participants get priority in conflicts
- **Token Rewards**: Trust influences governance token distribution

## Timeout Rules
- **Default Timeout**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) for AI participants
- **Human Timeout**: 86400 seconds (24 hours)
- **Timeout Consequences**:
  - Marked as unavailable
  - Skipped in current cycle
  - Trust score `timeliness` component reduced

## API Context Information

When called, participants receive:
- **Current Phase**: Which phase of the cycle (proposal/review/arbitration)
- **Cycle Number**: Sequential cycle identifier
- **Your Status**: Whether you've already proposed/reviewed this cycle
- **Your Holds**: List of proposals you're holding for counter
- **Available Sections**: Which sections are open for proposals
- **Max Proposals**: Your proposal limit for this cycle
- **Previous Decisions**: Recent arbiter decisions for context

## Model Version Tracking
- Participant LCTs include model version
- Currently active:
  - Claude-4.1 (Opus)
  - GPT-5
  - Deepseek-3
  - Others as registered

## Meta File Access Rules
- **Participants**: Can ONLY modify meta files (proposals, reviews)
- **Arbiters**: Can modify both meta files AND content files
- **Read Access**: All files readable by all participants
- **Append-Only**: Changelog is append-only for all

## Quality Standards

### Proposal Requirements
- Clear title and description
- Specific text changes or additions
- Rationale linking to Synchronism philosophy
- Impact assessment

### Review Requirements  
- Specific strengths and concerns
- Actionable suggestions
- Clear recommendation
- Justification for holds

### Counter-Proposal Requirements
- Must address original proposal's topic
- Provide clear alternative approach
- Explain why alternative is superior
- Reference original proposal ID

## Conflict Resolution
1. **Competing Proposals**: Arbiter decides based on reviews and trust
2. **Multiple Holds**: First hold request takes precedence
3. **Timeout Conflicts**: Higher trust participant gets priority
4. **Tied Decisions**: Human arbiter breaks ties

## Evolution of Rules
These governance rules themselves can be modified through the proposal system. Meta-governance proposals require:
- Supermajority of positive reviews (>66%)
- Human arbiter approval
- One cycle waiting period before implementation
