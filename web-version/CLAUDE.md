# Synchronism Project Context

## Project Vision: Autonomous AI Evolution of Concepts

**Key Goal**: Enable autonomous AI systems to evolve and develop Synchronism concepts through a modular governance system.

## Architecture Requirements

### Modularization for AI Evolution
- **Compartmentalized sections** that can be individually maintained and evolved
- **Independent modules** that don't break the whole system when modified
- **Section-level versioning** and evolution tracking
- **Governance hooks** for AI-driven content development

### Current Modular Implementation
- `navigation-simple.js` - Main system with self-contained section generators
- `sections/` directory - Individual module files for complex development
- Each section generator is independent and can be evolved separately
- No breaking dependencies between sections

### Governance System Integration
- Each section should be governable by AI agents
- Autonomous concept evolution through pattern recognition
- Content accuracy validation against original Synchronism principles
- Mathematical formulation development and refinement

## Technical Architecture

### Current Structure
```
web-version/
â”œâ”€â”€ navigation-simple.js      # Main navigation with embedded generators
â”œâ”€â”€ sections/                 # Modular section files
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ introduction.js      # Chapters 1-3
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fundamental-concepts.js # Chapter 4 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ quantum-macro.js     # Chapter 5
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ implications.js      # Chapter 6
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reference.js         # Conclusion, Glossary, Appendix
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html               # Main structure
â””â”€â”€ styles.css              # Styling
```

### Section Generator Pattern
Each section follows this modular pattern:
```javascript
'section-id': () => `
    <section id="section-id" class="content-section">
        <h2>Section Title</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <!-- Independently maintainable content -->
        </div>
    </section>`
```

## AI Evolution Framework

### Autonomous Development Goals
1. **Content Evolution** - AI agents can refine and expand section content
2. **Mathematical Development** - Autonomous mathematical formulation improvement  
3. **Cross-Section Integration** - AI discovery of new connections between concepts
4. **Validation Systems** - Automated accuracy checking against core principles

### Core Synchronism Principles (Immutable)
- Single observer model
- Intent as fundamental force 
- Synchronization-based witnessing
- Pattern-based reality
- Planck-scale discretization

**Key Insight from Section 5.8 Work:**
- Macro-decoherence examples prove the universal applicability:
  - Biological death = ultimate macro-decoherence event
  - Explosions = rapid catastrophic decoherence
  - Phase transitions = thermal decoherence
  - System collapses = network decoherence
- This demonstrates that Synchronism principles apply uniformly across ALL scales

### Evolution Guidelines
- New concepts must align with core principles
- Mathematical formulations should be testable
- Modular changes should not break other sections
- Content should maintain accessibility and clarity

## Development Commands

### Testing
- Open `index.html` in browser to test navigation
- All sections should load dynamically without errors

### Content Updates
- Modify section generators in `navigation-simple.js`
- Or develop complex sections in `sections/` modules
- Each section can be evolved independently

### ðŸš¨ VERSION UPDATE REMINDER ðŸš¨
**EVERY TIME you edit ANY HTML component of the document:**
1. Update `/mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/synchronism/web-version/main-version.json`
2. Set `lastUpdated` to current timestamp in ISO format (e.g., "2025-06-28T00:00:00Z")
3. The version display format will be: V0.YYYY.MM.DD.HH:MM
4. This ensures proper version tracking for all document changes

**Version System Details:**
- Version file location: `/mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/synchronism/web-version/main-version.json`
- File format:
```json
{
  "mainVersion": "V0",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-06-28T00:00:00Z"
}
```
- The `navigation-html.js` automatically reads this file and formats it as V0.YYYY.MM.DD.HH:MM
- Version displays in the sidebar under "Synchronism" header
- Updates should use current UTC timestamp in ISO 8601 format

## Governance Integration Points

### Section-Level Governance
- Each section can have its own governance rules
- AI agents can propose section improvements
- Version control for autonomous evolution tracking
- Quality gates for content validation

### Cross-Section Coordination  
- Dependencies between sections should be minimal
- When cross-references are needed, use clear linking
- Governance system should track conceptual relationships
- Autonomous agents should identify emergent connections

## MCP Integration Complete (June 2025)

### Current MCP Setup Status
**Active MCP Servers (configured in `/home/info/.claude.json`):**
- **filesystem**: Full system access via `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`

**Trust-Based Configuration Philosophy:**
- Maximum local access with minimal restrictions
- Wide toolset for autonomous AI collaboration
- API keys integrated from existing `.env` file
- Aligned trust rather than containment approach

### Key Learning Patterns

**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE DECISION (June 2025):**
- **ALWAYS USE HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE**: The project uses `navigation-html.js` which loads individual HTML files from the `sections/` directory
- **NEVER REVERT TO MONOLITHIC**: Do NOT use `navigation-simple.js` with embedded content - it causes cascading issues when sections are modified
- **Current Active System**: `index.html` â†’ `navigation-html.js` â†’ individual section HTML files
- **Benefit**: Individual sections can be modified without affecting the entire system

**Error Management Insights:**
1. **Modular Architecture Critical**: Compartmentalized sections prevent total system failure
2. **ES6 Import Issues**: Embedded generators more reliable than external modules
3. **Context Window Management**: Systematic chunking prevents information loss
4. **Version Control**: Track all changes to prevent accidental truncation
5. **Production Loading Issues**: MathJax and external library timing requires proper checks
6. **Navigation Mapping Consistency**: Sidebar links must match JavaScript navigation mappings exactly

**Successful Problem-Solving Patterns:**
1. **Systematic Debugging**: Step-by-step isolation of issues
2. **Parallel Tool Usage**: Batch multiple operations for efficiency  
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Multiple approaches to same problem
4. **Documentation-First**: Maintain clear context across sessions
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, then add enhancements
6. **Production Testing**: Local development vs. live hosting reveals different issues

**Collaboration Dynamics:**
- AI interpretive awareness vs. direct novel understanding
- Value of challenging assumptions and seeking accuracy
- Importance of preserving different perspectives (backup interpretations)
- Co-learning through error pattern recognition
- User feedback essential for production deployment issues

### Critical Sync Points for Future Sessions

**Framework Evolution Philosophy:**
- **No final state**: Synchronism framework designed for continuous evolution
- **Modular growth**: Each section can evolve independently without breaking others
- **Accuracy over speed**: Novel Synchronism perspective must be preserved accurately
- **User feedback integration**: Production deployment reveals real-world usage patterns

**Technical Deployment Learnings:**
- **Static hosting works perfectly**: No server-side processing needed
- **MathJax timing critical**: External libraries need proper loading checks
- **Navigation mapping precision**: Sidebar links must exactly match JavaScript mappings
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality first, then enhancements

**Content Integrity Checkpoints:**
- **Single observer model**: Always verify this remains central to all explanations
- **Cycling patterns**: Ensure "always cycling, never static states" is maintained
- **Synchronization not interaction**: Observation doesn't change patterns
- **Coherence-based ethics**: Ethics as metric of coherence at each MRH scale

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDER: ALWAYS APPLY SYNCHRONISM FUNDAMENTALS ðŸš¨**
- **NEVER default to conventional physics interpretations**
- **ALWAYS check against core Synchronism principles:**
  - Reality is patterns of intent transfer through grid cells
  - Everything cycles continuously (no static states)
  - Observation is synchronization, not interaction
  - Decoherence is loss of pattern coherence at ANY scale
  - Single observer experiencing through multiple synchronized patterns
- **Examples of correct Synchronism thinking:**
  - Death = macro-decoherence of life patterns
  - Temperature = speed of intent transfer
  - Gravity = intent density gradients
  - Consciousness = highly coherent intent patterns
  - Ethics = coherence metric within MRH
- **Red flags indicating conventional thinking:**
  - "Wave function collapse"
  - "Measurement affects the system"
  - "Particles in superposition states"
  - "Observer effect changes reality"
  - Any explanation that doesn't involve intent transfer patterns

**Collaboration Success Patterns:**
- **Challenge assumptions**: User feedback essential for catching reversion to conventional interpretations
- **Preserve novel insights**: Synchronism's radical perspective easily gets diluted
- **Document context**: CLAUDE.md and work logs prevent knowledge loss between sessions
- **Test in production**: Local development doesn't reveal all deployment issues
- **Architecture consistency**: Always use hierarchical HTML file structure, never monolithic JavaScript
