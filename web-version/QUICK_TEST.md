# Quick Navigation Test

## Fixed Issues ✅
- Fixed content appending instead of replacing in both debug and regular navigation
- Added console logging to regular navigation for troubleshooting

## Test Steps

### 1. Start Server
```bash
cd /mnt/c/projects/ai-agents/synchronism/web-version
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### 2. Test Regular Navigation
1. Open: http://localhost:8000
2. Open browser console (F12 → Console)
3. Click navigation links
4. Look for these console messages:
   ```
   Navigation: Found 16 nav links
   Navigation: Loading section introduction
   Navigation: loadSection called for introduction
   Navigation: HTML path for introduction = sections/01-introduction/index.html
   Navigation: Successfully loaded introduction (1234 chars)
   ```

### 3. Expected Behavior
- ✅ Introduction loads automatically on page load
- ✅ Clicking nav links replaces content (doesn't append)
- ✅ Status indicator shows current section
- ✅ Console shows successful loading messages

### 4. If Still Not Working
Check console for errors:
- **"dynamic-content element not found!"** → HTML structure issue
- **Fetch errors** → Server not running or file paths wrong
- **No console messages** → JavaScript not loading

## Test These Sections
All should now work:
- 1. Introduction ✅
- 2. Importance of Perspective ✅  
- 3. Hermetic Principles ✅
- 4. Fundamental Concepts ✅
- 4.1-4.12 All subsections ✅

## Still Pending
- Chapter 5 sections (will show "Not Yet Available")
- Chapter 6 sections (will show "Not Yet Available")
- Reference sections (will show "Not Yet Available")
