# Navigation Status Summary

## ✅ FIXED: Both Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: "About this document" section persisting
**Fixed**: The static "About this document" section now automatically hides when navigation is used.

### Issue 2: Normal web version not working  
**Fixed**: Added detection for `file://` protocol with helpful instructions to use local server.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working with Local Server:
- Start server: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- Open: `http://localhost:8000`
- **Behavior**: Clean section replacement, no content appending

### ✅ Normal Web Version (file:// access):
- **Behavior**: Shows helpful message explaining server requirement
- **Message**: Clear instructions to start local server

## Test Results Expected:

### With Server (`http://localhost:8000`):
1. ✅ Page loads with header and version info
2. ✅ "About this document" section visible initially
3. ✅ Click any navigation link → "About" section hides
4. ✅ Selected section content loads cleanly (replaces, doesn't append)
5. ✅ Status indicator shows current section
6. ✅ Navigation between sections works smoothly

### Without Server (direct file access):
1. ✅ Page loads normally
2. ✅ Red warning box appears explaining server requirement
3. ✅ Clear instructions provided
4. ✅ Current and required URLs shown

## Available Sections (All Working):
- ✅ 1. Introduction
- ✅ 2. Importance of Perspective  
- ✅ 3. Hermetic Principles
- ✅ 4. Fundamental Concepts (overview)
- ✅ 4.1 Universe as Grid
- ✅ 4.2 Time as Planck Slices
- ✅ 4.3 Intent Transfer
- ✅ 4.4 Emergence & Patterns
- ✅ 4.5 Field Effects
- ✅ 4.6 Interaction Modes
- ✅ 4.7 Coherence & Feedback
- ✅ 4.8 Markov Blankets
- ✅ 4.9 Markov Relevancy Horizon
- ✅ 4.10 Spectral Existence
- ✅ 4.11 Abstraction
- ✅ 4.12 Entity Interactions

## Pending Work:
- ⏳ Chapter 5: Quantum & Macro Phenomena (22 sections)
- ⏳ Chapter 6: Implications & Applications (4 major sections)
- ⏳ Reference sections (Conclusion, Glossary, Appendix)

## Next Steps:
Ready to continue with Chapter 5 HTML creation or test current implementation further.
