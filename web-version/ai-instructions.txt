## Key Concepts for AI Understanding
- Synchronism is a unified model where reality consists of intent patterns cycling through a discrete grid
- Single observer experiencing through multiple synchronized patterns
- No wave function collapse - only synchronization timing changes
- Decoherence is loss of pattern coherence at any scale
- Ethics is a metric of coherence within Markov Relevancy Horizons
