# 1. Introduction

Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* You might want to acknowledge early on that “comprehensive” is an aspirational stance rather than a claim of completeness, to avoid triggering skepticism from scientific readers.

Developed through a series of philosophical inquiries and thought experiments, Synchronism attempts to bridge the gap between scientific understanding and spiritual or metaphysical concepts.

In the Synchronism model, a key concept is that of "Intent," which serves as a reification of the abstract "greater force" proposed by various belief systems. This reification allows for the quantification and analysis of the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable "intent," Synchronism provides a framework that bridges scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* Consider emphasizing that “intent” in this context is not anthropomorphic—it’s not personal will, but a universal driver.

The model proposes a fundamental structure for the universe based on discrete units of space and time, with a unique concept of "intent" as the driving force behind all interactions and emergent phenomena. By offering a new lens through which to view reality, Synchronism challenges conventional thinking and invites a reevaluation of our understanding of existence, consciousness, and the nature of the universe itself.

## Key Concept: Single Observer Model

Synchronism is inherently a single-observer model, meaning that all phenomena are interpreted from the standpoint of a singular, unified observer. This perspective simplifies the complexities associated with multiple reference frames and provides a coherent narrative of intent transfer and emergence.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* It might help to define this “observer” more clearly—is it the universe? The framework? A metaphor?

By assuming a single, uniform progression of time across the universe, Synchronism aligns perception experienced at varying fractal scales with the underlying mechanics of reality, focusing on how intent flows and interacts within this unified framework.

This approach contrasts with relativistic models, which allow for multiple "observers" with potentially conflicting perceptions of time and space. In Synchronism, time and space are absolute within the single observer's framework, providing a consistent reference for understanding the universe's evolution.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* A footnote or pointer about how this relates to or diverges from relativity/general relativity could enhance comprehension for technical audiences.

## Key Concept: Limitations and Perspectives

The limitations of individual perspectives, as highlighted in the parable of the blind men and the elephant, underscore the need for a comprehensive model like Synchronism that strives for a holistic understanding of reality. However, Synchronism acknowledges the practical usefulness of limited-perspective analysis.

This is addressed with concepts like [Markov Relevancy Horizon](#mrh), [Abstraction](#abstraction), [Witness](#witness-effect), and Experience.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* Consider clarifying that these tools are not replacements for traditional scientific method but extensions to accommodate multi-scale coherence.

## Key Concept: Mathematical Formalism

For Synchronism to be a useful and relevant model, it is necessary to introduce formal mathematical treatments for its key concepts. In order to keep the core document concise, the proposed mathematical formalism is introduced separately in [Appendix A](#appendix-a).

> 💬 *Suggestion:* A preview of the mathematical approach (algebraic, geometric, categorical?) would be useful here, even briefly.
