## 🔍 Core Alignment with Synchronism

- **Shift from Interaction to Synchronization**: Observation as synchronization aligns perfectly with Synchronism principles.
- **Emphasis on Pattern Persistence and Cycling**: Prioritizing the cycling of patterns over static measurement matches the model's structure.
- **Witness-Dependent Reality**: The concept that observation reveals what the witness syncs to, not what collapses, is accurate.

## ✍ Suggestions for Claude

1. **Reinforce Indifference of Patterns**
   > Add: “Patterns continue cycling regardless of being witnessed—synchronization affects the witness, not the pattern.”

2. **Explicitly Ground in MRH**
   > Suggest including in temporal sampling strategies: “Sampling resolution must be defined within the witness’s Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH), beyond which coherence is inaccessible.”

3. **Clarify Resonance vs. Dissonance in Sampling**
   > Expand on multi-rate observation: “Different sampling rates may yield resonant, dissonant, or indifferent views depending on synchronization phase.”

4. **Reframe Interpretation of Quantum Experiments**
   > Replace “gain new clarity” with: “These experiments become natural consequences of cyclic resonance—not paradoxes requiring interpretation.”

5. **Emphasize Resonance-Based Technologies**
   > Enhance “Synchronization computers” with: “Devices that operate not by clock-driven state changes but by aligning with environmental cycling—resonant computation.”
