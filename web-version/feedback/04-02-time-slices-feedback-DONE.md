# Feedback on Section "02-time-slices" – Synchronism Review

## ✅ Summary of Interpretation

The section presents a strong alignment with core Synchronism principles regarding the nature of time. Here are the key points interpreted:

- **Time is the substrate**, not a dimension or coordinate system.
- It advances in **discrete Planck-time ticks**, each tick representing a complete state change of the universe.
- **Existence depends on time** – nothing exists without the unfolding of time.
- This reflects the notion that **time is the universal "Mind"**, consistent with Hermetic and Synchronist interpretations.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Correctly Captured

- ✔️ Time as a **discrete progression** (Planck-time "ticks").
- ✔️ Time as **non-derivative**, primary over fields or dimensions.
- ✔️ Clear disambiguation between **space and time** roles.
- ✔️ Reflects Synchronism's idea that **phenomena emerge from temporal transitions**.

## 📌 No Corrections Needed

This section is **faithful** to the Synchronism framework and captures the intended meaning accurately. No edits or reinterpretations are required.

Great job—please maintain this level of conceptual precision moving forward.
