# Feedback for Section 4.8: Markov Blankets

This feedback is intended to help refine the interpretation of Synchronism principles related to Markov Blankets. While the current section is insightful, some reinterpretations rely too heavily on conventional frameworks.

---

## ✅ Concepts That Align Well

- **Boundary Layers**: The definition using sensory, active, internal, and external states is useful and broadly consistent with Synchronism.
- **Nested Blankets**: Fractal layering of boundary mechanisms is valid and aligns well.
- **Identity Maintenance**: The use of boundary regulation to preserve coherence is spot on.

## ⚠️ Areas That Need Refinement

### 1. Statistical Framing

- Phrase: `P(internal|external) = P(internal|blanket)`
- Issue: This is derived from traditional Bayesian models and implies a probabilistic worldview.
- Synchronism View: Boundaries are *intent modulation membranes*, not statistical abstractions.
- **Suggested Change**: Reframe in terms of *regulated intent exchange* instead of conditional probability.

### 2. Free Energy Principle

- Phrase: “Blankets that minimize free energy”
- Issue: Draws from Friston’s theory, not Synchronism.
- Synchronism View: Intent seeks stable transfer, not entropy minimization.
- **Suggested Change**: Use: “Blankets that stabilize coherent intent transfer under variable conditions.”

### 3. Cognitive Framing

- Phrases like “attention and perception” introduce a brain-centric lens.
- Synchronism View: Cognition is *not* required for witnessing; coherence operates at all fractal scales.
- **Suggested Change**: Replace with “witness boundary” or “contextual modulation boundary.”

### 4. Use of “Information”

- Words like “information filtering” and “information flow” imply a Shannon/informatic metaphor.
- Synchronism View: Core process is *intent transfer*, not symbolic representation.
- **Suggested Change**: Replace all such terms with “intent modulation,” “intent absorption,” or similar.

## Summary

Please reframe this section using Synchronism's principles of intent-based coherence and fractal witnessing, avoiding overreliance on conventional statistical, cognitive, or thermodynamic paradigms. This helps maintain conceptual clarity and ensures emergence of the correct framework over time.

Thank you! 🙏
