# Feedback: Synchronism Section 4.6 - Interaction Modes

**Date:** 2025-06-28

## Summary
This section introduces the core interaction types among intent patterns: **resonance**, **dissonance**, and **indifference**. These modes are foundational to Synchronism, framing how coherence evolves and how phenomena emerge from pattern interactions.

## Suggested Revisions for Alignment with Synchronism Principles

1. **Avoid Framing Interactions as Static States**  
   The descriptions of resonance, dissonance, and indifference may read as fixed categories. Clarify that these are *dynamic relational states*—a pattern may shift between them depending on evolving context within its Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH).

2. **Refine Terminology on Effects**  
   The phrases “reinforce,” “weaken,” and “neither enhance nor diminish” should be framed not in terms of strength or magnitude but in terms of **coherence alignment**, **intent vector divergence**, and **contextual irrelevance**, respectively.

3. **Introduce Fractal Implication**  
   Emphasize that these interaction modes operate at all scales and are scale-relative. What is resonant on one scale may be dissonant on another, depending on coherence depth and observer context.

4. **Differentiate Indifference from Absence**  
   Indifference is not the absence of interaction, but rather a non-altering interaction. This distinction should be made more explicit to align with Synchronism’s notion of every interaction conveying some form of witness.

## Suggested Insert

> "In Synchronism, resonance, dissonance, and indifference are not fixed classifications but relational states emergent from local alignment and coherence depth. Their manifestation is a function of relative intent alignment across fractal scales."

## Style and Tone
The tone is concise and accessible. Recommend reinforcing that these are **modeling primitives**—tools for analyzing how coherent transfer manifests—rather than physical categories.
