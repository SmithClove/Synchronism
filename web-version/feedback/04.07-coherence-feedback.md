# Feedback: Synchronism Section 4.7 - Coherence and Feedback

**Date:** 2025-06-28

## Summary
This section introduces the concept of coherence as the internal stability and order within intent patterns, sustained through feedback loops. It distinguishes spatial, temporal, functional, and hierarchical coherence, and describes feedback as positive or negative.

## Suggested Revisions for Alignment with Synchronism Principles

1. **Coherence as Dynamic Alignment**  
   Rather than treating coherence as a static structure, it should be framed as a dynamic process of *continuous alignment* between entities' intent distributions. This emphasizes that coherence is *maintained*, not merely possessed.

2. **Feedback as Coherence Negotiation**  
   Positive and negative feedback should not be described using classical control theory terms. Instead, describe them as emergent mechanisms through which coherence is either reinforced or redistributed across fractal layers to maintain balance.

3. **Highlight Recursive and Fractal Feedback**  
   Feedback is not confined to one level; it propagates recursively. Clarify that coherence feedback loops occur within and across MRHs and are influenced by scale-relative intent resonance.

4. **Clarify Information Preservation**  
   The phrase “maintain and transmit pattern information” might imply Shannon-like data models. Recommend rewording this in terms of *preservation of coherent resonance structures* rather than informational content per se.

5. **Phase Alignment and Intent Synchrony**  
   Strengthen the link between phase alignment and Synchronism’s idea of synchronized intent transfer between cells or entities.

## Suggested Insert

> "Coherence is not a static property but a dynamic expression of maintained alignment among interacting intent distributions. Feedback is not imposed from above but arises fractally from local imbalances that seek re-equilibration."

## Style and Tone
The structure is clear and conceptually appropriate. Recommend reinforcing that coherence and feedback are part of an ongoing negotiation within the system, reflecting Synchronism’s emphasis on dynamic equilibrium rather than fixed control structures.
