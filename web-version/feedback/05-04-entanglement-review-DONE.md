### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section strongly and elegantly aligns with Synchronism through its “raster entanglement” analogy:

- **Perfect Synchronization**: The CRT dual-screen analogy precisely models entangled behavior as synchronized cycling rather than state correlation.
- **No Transmission**: Emphasizes that no information passes between patterns—distance doesn’t matter, only phase alignment.
- **Pattern Origin & Interaction**: Rightly attributes synchronization to shared origin or intentional alignment through interaction.
- **Bell’s Theorem**: Provides an intuitive reinterpretation of Bell test violations through persistent sync rather than nonlocal causality.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Elevate 'Raster Entanglement' Framing**
   - Give the term more prominence—it’s a valuable branding of Synchronism’s take on entanglement and could benefit from early emphasis and potential reuse elsewhere.

2. **Clarify Phase Sync Implications**
   - Suggest explicitly stating: “Because both patterns cycle identically, syncing with one guarantees a known sync with the other.”

3. **Avoid Ambiguity in 'Environmental Isolation'**
   - Clarify that isolation is not required for entanglement itself but helps prevent decoherence from external interference.

4. **Bell’s Theorem Simplification**
   - Recommend clarifying that traditional interpretations assume probabilistic collapse, while Synchronism reframes it as deterministic synchronization perceived as probabilistic due to sync uncertainty.

5. **Bridge to Decoherence**
   - Suggest adding a forward-link sentence: “When synchronization breaks, the patterns decohere—explored in the next section.”

A strong and well-aligned section. Just minor enhancements needed.
