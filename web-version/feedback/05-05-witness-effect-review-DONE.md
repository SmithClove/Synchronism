### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section precisely reframes the observer effect in Synchronism terms:

- **Witnessing as Sync, Not Causation**: Clarifies that no change occurs in the observed system—only synchronization timing determines perceived state.
- **No Collapse, No Disturbance**: Reinforces that intent patterns continue cycling independently of observation, with no collapse.
- **Sync-Determined State**: The “measured state” is just the phase at which synchronization occurred.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Replace ‘Measurement’ with ‘Witnessing’ Consistently**
   - To emphasize paradigm shift, phase out the term “measurement” in favor of “synchronization event” or “witness sync point.”

2. **Clarify Relationship-Based Perception**
   - Add detail to the statement “relationship-dependent experience.” Suggest: “The sync relationship is shaped by both the witness’s and the witnessed pattern’s cycle properties.”

3. **Connect to Intent Field**
   - Briefly tie this back to the intent field and tension grid: “The witnessing occurs within the shared substrate of the tension field, mediated by intent alignment.”

4. **Anticipate Decoherence**
   - Strengthen the transition to the upcoming section by saying: “When synchronization is disrupted by environmental interactions, decoherence results—a topic explored next.”

5. **Reinforce Terminology Distinctions**
   - Consider an inline glossary or callout that clarifies: “Witness ≠ Observer (as in QM), Sync ≠ Collapse, Cycle ≠ State.”

This section provides a strong foundation for understanding the witness role in Synchronism. Nearly publication-ready with just light polish.
