### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section effectively reframes the universal speed limit (c) through the Synchronism lens:

- **Grid Throughput, Not Spacetime Law**: The speed of light reflects the max rate at which intent patterns can be processed through the Planck-scale grid.
- **Integrity vs. Velocity Tradeoff**: Beyond a certain point, maintaining coherence of complex patterns becomes computationally unsustainable.
- **Variable Limits by Complexity**: Unlike the one-size-fits-all speed limit of relativity, Synchronism proposes entity-specific velocity ceilings based on structural complexity.
- **Probabilistic Transitions as Emergent Filter**: High-complexity entities degrade under extreme velocity due to lower intent transfer success probability—introducing a natural “speed sieve.”

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Emphasize c as Emergent, Not Fundamental**
   - Reword to reinforce that c is a *byproduct* of grid behavior, not a hardcoded law of the universe.

2. **Clarify “Computational Matrix” Terminology**
   - Some readers may interpret “computational” mechanistically—consider framing it as “intent-mediated discrete substrate” or similar.

3. **Introduce Coherence Envelope Concept**
   - Suggest mentioning that each pattern has a coherence envelope defined by its complexity and required sync rate.

4. **Bridge to Decoherence and Next Section**
   - Conclude by signaling: “When coherence fails due to exceeding the grid’s capacity, decoherence results—explored further next.”

5. **Reframe ‘Probability’ in Synchronism Terms**
   - Avoid invoking classical quantum probability—clarify it as “likelihood of maintaining synchronized intent transfer across steps.”

Strong alignment overall—minor refinements will sharpen clarity and coherence.
