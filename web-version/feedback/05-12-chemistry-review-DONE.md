### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section offers a coherent Synchronism-based reinterpretation of molecular science:

- **Bonds as Coherent Overlaps**: Bonds are stabilized overlaps of intent patterns with lowered energy due to coherent alignment.
- **Atoms as Intent Containers**: Nuclei concentrate high-stability patterns; electrons represent distributed, probabilistic field harmonics.
- **Orbital Resonance**: Orbitals emerge as resonant standing waves of intent distribution—quantized outcomes of pattern coherence.
- **Bond Variety via Coherence Types**: Classical bonds are reinterpreted as distinct alignment modes of pattern interaction.
- **Molecular Geometry as Pattern Optimization**: Shape reflects the emergent organization of overlapping pattern nodes seeking energy efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clarify Probabilistic vs. Coherent Descriptions**
   - Avoid ambiguity by explaining that “probabilistic” in Synchronism reflects partial or unstable synchronization rather than quantum randomness.

2. **Avoid Unqualified Classical Terms**
   - Suggest prefacing terms like “orbitals” and “electrons” with qualifiers: “in Synchronism, these refer to...” to guide re-interpretation.

3. **Expand on Pattern Stability Criteria**
   - Recommend elaborating: “Stable bonds form when overlapping intent cycles reinforce each other without decoherence.”

4. **Introduce Molecular Fields**
   - Add a bridge sentence: “These molecular patterns are local field configurations—resonant nodes in the larger tension grid.”

5. **Connect to Higher-Order Chemistry**
   - Hint at biological coherence: “These foundational patterns give rise to life-supporting complexity—explored in future sections.”
