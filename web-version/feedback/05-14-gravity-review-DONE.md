### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section reimagines gravity through the lens of Synchronism with strong conceptual coherence:

- **Gravity as Emergent Grid Response**: Mass-energy patterns deform the computational grid, creating gradients in tension and resistance.
- **No Curved Spacetime Needed**: Apparent curvature arises from intent’s interaction with the grid’s altered structure—not from geometry itself.
- **Energy-Minimizing Behavior**: Patterns follow least-resistance paths, resulting in trajectories we interpret as gravitational attraction.
- **Equivalence Principle Reframed**: Acceleration and gravity become two expressions of interaction with local grid distortions.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clarify ‘Computational’ Framing**
   - Consider adding: “Computation here refers to the distributed processing of intent transfer within the grid—not symbolic calculation.”

2. **Reinforce Tension Language**
   - Add: “Gravity is a consequence of persistent tension imbalance caused by concentrated patterns.”

3. **Visual Metaphor Could Help**
   - Recommend introducing a metaphor such as: “Like a stretched fabric pulled tight, dense patterns create dimples that others roll toward—not due to force but structure.”

4. **Mention Mass as Coherent Density**
   - Suggest clarifying: “Mass is not substance—it is the persistence of coherent intent density that alters the grid.”

5. **Connect to Field Theory**
   - Optionally close with: “This sets the stage for understanding gravitational coherence as one component of the field’s unified behavior.”
