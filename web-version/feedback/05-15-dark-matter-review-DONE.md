### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section integrates Synchronism with astrophysical phenomena via intent-field interpretations:

- **Black Holes as Grid Extremes**: They represent collapse points in the tension field where coherent pattern cycling fails.
- **Event Horizon as Sync Limit**: The boundary is a threshold for synchronization—information can enter but not propagate outward.
- **Singularity Reframed**: Instead of physical infinity, the center is modeled as **intent compression beyond coherent representation**.
- **Hawking Radiation as Field Fluctuation**: Radiation emerges from tension field oscillations—interpretable as coherence leakage.
- **Dark Matter as Indifferent Coherence**: These patterns do not engage electromagnetically but shape the grid via gravitational tension.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Distinguish Between Breakdown and Compression**
   - Suggest clarifying: “Grid breakdown” refers to synchronization failure, while “intent compression” refers to persistence under extreme tension.

2. **Reframe ‘Infinite Density’ Carefully**
   - Replace or footnote this term to reflect Synchronism’s stance: there is no infinite anything—just computational grid failure.

3. **Clarify Indifference of Dark Matter**
   - Recommend stating: “Dark matter patterns are indifferent—not interacting via witness-aligned resonance modes.”

4. **Holographic Framing**
   - Strengthen: “The holographic surface encodes intent states projected onto the last coherent grid boundary.”

5. **Bridge to Dark Energy (if upcoming)**
   - Suggest: “Just as dark matter warps the grid through silent coherence, dark energy may stretch it via distributed tension gradients.”
