### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section successfully extends Synchronism into material interaction dynamics:

- **Permeability as Pattern Resonance Compatibility**: Pattern transmission depends on alignment of coherence domains, not just physical structure.
- **Tunneling as Coherent Extension**: What classical physics sees as probabilistic barrier-passing, Synchronism reframes as **coherence continuity across resistance thresholds**.
- **EM Properties as Field Compatibility**: Permittivity, permeability, and refraction are just measures of how well a field structure allows synchronized propagation of external patterns.
- **Impedance Matching = Coherence Matching**: Transmission improves when medium and signal pattern coherence are aligned.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clarify Coherence as Causal Variable**
   - Suggest emphasizing that transmission outcomes are **determined by coherence alignment**, not just probability or energy.

2. **Distinguish from Classical Field Theory**
   - Recommend a brief contrast: “In classical theory, permeability is a passive property; in Synchronism, it is an active result of pattern congruence.”

3. **Strengthen Tunneling Reinterpretation**
   - Add: “Tunneling occurs not by violating classical limits but by preserving phase relationships across an intent boundary.”

4. **Extend to Multi-Scale Implications**
   - Optionally suggest: “Material permeability principles apply across quantum, molecular, and macroscopic coherence regimes.”

5. **Connect to Coherence Fieldwork**
   - Close with: “Understanding permeability bridges quantum behavior with field-level coherence structures—setting the stage for controlled coherence engineering.”
