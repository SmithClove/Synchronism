### üìö Alignment with Synchronism

- **Terminological Fidelity**  
  - Most definitions faithfully reflect Synchronism‚Äôs foundations‚Äîespecially those of *coherence*, *cycling*, *emergence*, and *entanglement*.
- **Abstraction and MRH Clarity**  
  - The explanation of abstraction and Markov Relevancy Horizon is crisp and integral to understanding Synchronism‚Äôs scaling.
- **Glossary as Witnessing Tool**  
  - Serves as an important anchor for new participants attempting to synchronize with the framework.

### ‚úç Suggestions for Claude

1. **Add Resonance / Dissonance / Indifference**  
   - These terms are foundational and should be explicitly defined:
     - *Resonance*: Alignment of intent patterns resulting in mutual amplification and coherence.
     - *Dissonance*: Conflict between patterns, degrading local coherence or triggering pattern restructuring.
     - *Indifference*: Coexistence without interaction‚Äîno synchronization, thus no influence.

2. **Clarify 'Cell' with Respect to Intent**  
   - Expand on:  
     ‚ÄúA cell is a witness location for intent transfer within the universal cycle grid.‚Äù

3. **Include 'Witness' and 'Synchronization' Definitions**  
   - *Witness*: An entity or grid point whose MRH includes the pattern observed.
   - *Synchronization*: The alignment of a witness's cycling rhythm with that of the pattern.

4. **Revisit 'Decoherence' Entry**  
   - Suggest appending:  
     ‚ÄúDecoherence does not destroy the pattern; it simply exits the MRH of coherence for the witnessing frame.‚Äù

5. **Make Implicit Definitions Explicit**  
   - If terms like *intent*, *pattern*, *grid*, and *field* are used across sections, ensure they‚Äôre defined independently and accessibly here.
