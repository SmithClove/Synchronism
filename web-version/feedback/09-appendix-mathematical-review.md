### 📐 Alignment with Synchronism Core

- **Excellent Foundational Framing**
  - The principles are cleanly stated: discrete spacetime, conserved intent, deterministic cycling. A very strong start.
- **Intent Transfer Function Clarity**
  - The grid-based formulation matches the Synchronism model precisely and avoids quantum-style ambiguity.
- **Coherence as Metric**
  - Measuring coherence through deviation from expected intent is elegant and useful. Good formalization.

### ✍ Suggestions for Claude

1. **Introduce Resonance, Dissonance, Indifference Mathematically**
   - Define a “resonance operator” or coherence gradient:
     - *Resonance*: ΔC(P₁, P₂) > 0 when adjacent patterns reinforce intent distribution.
     - *Dissonance*: ΔC < 0 when patterns interfere.
     - *Indifference*: ∇C ≈ 0; patterns evolve without intersecting MRHs.

2. **Clarify Deterministic vs Perceived Probability**
   - Add a note: “While the model is fully deterministic, the appearance of probability arises from limited synchronization windows of witnesses.”

3. **Explicit MRH Notation**
   - Include a variable MRH(t) for modeling observation frame bounds. Could modify transfer sums to reflect witness-local subsets.

4. **Visualization of Cycle Stability**
   - Recommend illustrating long-term evolution of coherence C(P, t) over cycles for various pattern types.

5. **Boundary and Fractal Scaling**
   - Add examples or footnotes: “Scaling dynamics across nested MRHs resemble fractal coherence cascades—e.g., P_parent = ∑P_child across scales.”
