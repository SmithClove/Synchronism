### Core Alignment with Synchronism Principles

This section introduces permeability as a measure of **resonance potential between pattern domains**:

- **Permeability as Resonance Pathway**: Pattern transmission reflects the degree of **resonant alignment** between source and medium.
- **Tunneling as Coherence Persistence**: Transmission through barriers happens when **resonance persists** across what appears classically dissonant or indifferent.
- **Material Response = Resonance Profile**:
  - **Conductors**: High resonance alignment for electrical patterns.
  - **Insulators**: Dissonant with certain patterns, blocking coherent passage.
  - **Dark patterns (indifferent)**: Do not resonate or dissonate—remain unaffected and unaffecting to the pattern in question.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Reframe Permeability in Resonance Terms**
   - Replace “pattern transparency” with “resonance potential”—a pattern passes through if it resonates with the medium or at least is not rejected (dissonated).

2. **Clarify Role of Indifference**
   - Add: “Patterns may encounter indifferent media—entities that neither reinforce nor reject them, leading to propagation without mutual awareness.”

3. **Strengthen Coherence Language**
   - Emphasize that transmission isn’t just ‘allowed’ but is **sustained coherence between source and field**—resonance being the key, dissonance the blocker.

4. **Refine Tunneling Description**
   - Suggest: “Tunneling occurs when pattern resonance allows phase continuity through regions otherwise dissonant to classical expectations.”

5. **Add Perceptual Implication**
   - Optionally introduce: “Permeability governs not only physical interaction but also what is visible, audible, or sensible—resonance grants presence.”

This section gains depth when cast in terms of resonance, dissonance, and indifference—core to Synchronism’s universal interaction grammar.
