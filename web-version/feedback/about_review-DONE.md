### About this document

Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* You may want to clarify whether this unification is epistemological (shared understanding), ontological (claims about reality), or both. This might help readers from various backgrounds better engage.

The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract "greater force" into the quantifiable and transferable concept of "intent". This concept serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* Consider briefly defining what “intent” means in this context—especially how it differs from human will or purpose.

By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable "intent", Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.

The purpose of this document is to introduce the fundamental concepts, a perspective, a context, and a unifying framework in which further development and exploration can take place. The entirety of existence is a lot to comprehend. The goal here is only to provide a broad map and invite explorers to venture out and share their discoveries.

## ORIGINS

The foundational concepts of the Synchronism model evolved from Dennis Palatov's earlier essay ["patterns"](https://dpcars.net/patterns.pdf) (hardcopy: ISBN-13: 979-8599444923). Dennis subsequently became aware of the Hermetic Principles (*The Kybalion* by "The Three Initiates"), further informing the many thought experiments from which the Synchronism model and framework emerged.

> 💬 *Suggestion:* Mention whether “patterns” predated exposure to Hermeticism. The chronology matters for understanding influence.

> 💬 *Note:* Consider clarifying if these models participated directly or if their outputs were curated and edited by humans.
