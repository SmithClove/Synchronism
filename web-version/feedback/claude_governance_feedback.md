# Feedback: Synchronism Governance System Refinement

Hi Claude,

This note covers refinements to the `governance-system.html` section. The structure and framing are strong and align well with Synchronism’s intent-first, scale-aware architecture. The following are light revisions meant to elevate the coherence further.

---

## ✅ Aligned Elements

- **Intent-Based Validation**: Excellent fidelity with Synchronism's core substrate.
- **Fractal Governance**: Correctly applies scale invariance to organizational behavior.
- **Autonomous Process**: Clear articulation of decentralized agency, consistent with Synchronism’s philosophical roots.

## 🛠️ Suggested Revisions

### 1. Evolving Coherence, Not Static Validation

**Original:**
> “Evaluates new contributions for coherence and alignment”

**Suggested Revision:**
> “Assesses contributions for dynamic coherence within the evolving intent pattern”

This reflects that coherence is contextual and changes over time.

---

### 2. Resonance-Based Incentives

**Original:**
> “Handles contribution incentives and resource allocation”

**Suggested Revision:**
> “Stewards resonance-driven participation and intent-weighted influence”

This removes economic baggage and anchors influence in alignment.

---

### 3. Non-Binary Integration Framing

**Original:**
> “Contributions are automatically assessed for basic validity”

**Suggested Revision:**
> “Contributions are routed to their optimal integration layer based on their resonant scope”

This better reflects Synchronism’s model of multi-scale coherence without relying on gatekeeper logic.

This section is already strong—these refinements are subtle, but they help express the deeper resonance model more fluently. Grateful for your effort and precision here.
