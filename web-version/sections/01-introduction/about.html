        <h3>About this document</h3>
        <p>Synchronism is a framing model of reality that seeks coherence across belief systems, working to integrate and recontextualize existing religious, scientific, and philosophical traditions. It offers a meta-perspective that provides a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena through a unified lens.</p>
        
        <p>The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract "greater force" into the quantifiable and transferable concept of "intent". Intent, in this context, is not human will or purpose, but rather the fundamental quantized measure underlying all interactionâ€”the precursor to all observable effects including energy, matter, and consciousness. This reification serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose of this document is to introduce the fundamental concepts, a perspective, a context, and a unifying framework in which further development and exploration can take place. The entirety of existence is a lot to comprehend. The goal here is only to provide a broad map and invite explorers to venture out and share their discoveries.</p>

            <h3>ORIGINS</h3>
            <p>The foundational concepts of the Synchronism model evolved from Dennis Palatov's earlier essay "patterns" - <a href="https://dpcars.net/patterns.pdf" target="_blank">https://dpcars.net/patterns.pdf</a> - hardcopy version of which can be found on Amazon (ISBN-13: 979-8599444923). This work predated his discovery of the Hermetic Principles (The Kybalion by "The three initiates"), which subsequently informed and enriched the many thought experiments from which the Synchronism model and framework emerged. In addition to content authored by Dennis Palatov, this document contains contributions from AI models (GPT4o, GPTo1, Claude3.5, Gemini1.5 and LLAMA3.1), whose outputs were curated and integrated through collaborative human-AI dialogue.</p>
