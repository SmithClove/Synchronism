        <h3>About this document</h3>
        <p>Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena.</p>
        
        <p>The key concept of Synchronism is the reification of the abstract "greater force" into the quantifiable and transferable concept of "intent". This concept serves as the foundation for the entire Synchronism model, providing a tangible framework for understanding the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable "intent", Synchronism bridges the gap between scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.</p>
        
        <p>The purpose of this document is to introduce the fundamental concepts, a perspective, a context, and a unifying framework in which further development and exploration can take place. The entirety of existence is a lot to comprehend. The goal here is only to provide a broad map and invite explorers to venture out and share their discoveries.</p>

            <h3>ORIGINS</h3>
            <p>The foundational concepts of the Synchronism model evolved from Dennis Palatov's earlier essay "patterns" - <a href="https://dpcars.net/patterns.pdf" target="_blank">https://dpcars.net/patterns.pdf</a> - hardcopy version of which can be found on Amazon (ISBN-13: 979-8599444923). Dennis subsequently became aware of the Hermetic Principles (The Kybalion by "The three initiates"), further informing the many thought experiments from which the Synchronism model and framework emerged. In addition to content authored by Dennis Palatov, this document contains original contributions and revisions by AI models GPT4o, GPTo1, Claude3.5, Gemini1.5 and LLAMA3.1.</p>
