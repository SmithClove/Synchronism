            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Synchronism is a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify and transcend existing belief systems, including religions and scientific theories. It offers a perspective that aims to encompass all aspects of existence, providing a framework for understanding the universe and its phenomena.</p>
                
                <p>Developed through a series of philosophical inquiries and thought experiments, Synchronism attempts to bridge the gap between scientific understanding and spiritual or metaphysical concepts.</p>
                
                <p>In the Synchronism model, a key concept is that of "Intent," which serves as a reification of the abstract "greater force" proposed by various belief systems. This reification allows for the quantification and analysis of the underlying dynamics of reality. By representing the fundamental driving force of the universe as measurable "intent," Synchronism provides a framework that bridges scientific, philosophical, and spiritual perspectives, enabling a more unified approach to understanding existence.</p>
                
                <p>The model proposes a fundamental structure for the universe based on discrete units of space and time, with a unique concept of "intent" as the driving force behind all interactions and emergent phenomena. By offering a new lens through which to view reality, Synchronism challenges conventional thinking and invites a reevaluation of our understanding of existence, consciousness, and the nature of the universe itself.</p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h3>Single Observer Model</h3>
                    <p>Synchronism is inherently a single-observer model, meaning that all phenomena are interpreted from the standpoint of a singular, unified observer. This perspective simplifies the complexities associated with multiple reference frames and provides a coherent narrative of intent transfer and emergence.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>By assuming a single, uniform progression of time across the universe, Synchronism aligns perception experienced at varying fractal scales with the underlying mechanics of reality, focusing on how intent flows and interacts within this unified framework.</p>
                
                <p>This approach contrasts with relativistic models, which allow for multiple "observers" with potentially conflicting perceptions of time and space. In Synchronism, time and space are absolute within the single observer's framework, providing a consistent reference for understanding the universe's evolution. This singular viewpoint is crucial for maintaining coherence within the model and ensuring that emergent phenomena are uniformly interpretable.</p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h3>Limitations and Perspectives</h3>
                    <p>The limitations of individual perspectives, as highlighted in the parable of the blind men and the elephant, underscore the need for a comprehensive model like Synchronism that strives for a holistic understanding of reality. However, Synchronism acknowledges the practical usefulness of limited-perspective analysis.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>This is addressed with concepts like <a href="#mrh">Markov Relevancy Horizon</a>, <a href="#abstraction">Abstraction</a>, <a href="#witness-effect">Witness</a> and Experience as part of the Synchronism model.</p>
                
                <div class="key-concept">
                    <h3>Mathematical Formalism</h3>
                    <p>For Synchronism to be a useful and relevant model, it is necessary to introduce formal mathematical treatments for its key concepts. In order to keep the core document as concise as possible, the proposed mathematical formalism is introduced separately in <a href="#appendix-a">Appendix A</a>.</p>
