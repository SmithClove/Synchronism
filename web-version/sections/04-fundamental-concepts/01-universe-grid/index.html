    <h2>4.1 Universe as a Grid of Planck Cells</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>Synchronism proposes that the universe can be modeled as an infinite three-dimensional grid of discrete cells. This concept provides a fundamental structure for understanding the nature of space and the interactions that occur within it.</p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>Grid Structure</h3>
            <p>Key aspects of this grid model include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each cell is the size of a Planck length (approximately 1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ meters) in each dimension. The Planck length is theorized to be the smallest meaningful measurement of distance in the universe.</li>
                <li>The grid extends infinitely in all directions, encompassing the entire universe.</li>
                <li>Each cell contains a quantized amount of "<a href="#intent-transfer">intent</a>," which can be thought of as a fundamental property or energy that drives all interactions and phenomena in the universe.</li>
                <li>The amount of intent in each cell is limited by a saturation maximum, beyond which no more intent can be added to that cell.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="mathematical-note">
            <h3>Mathematical Foundation</h3>
            <p>This discrete spatial structure enables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Precise Location Definition:</strong> Grid coordinates for every point</li>
                <li><strong>Quantized Interactions:</strong> All phenomena in discrete units</li>
                <li><strong>Intent Conservation:</strong> Total intent precisely tracked</li>
                <li><strong>Transfer Mechanics:</strong> Intent moves only between adjacent cells</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Connection to Hermetic Principles</h3>
            <p>The grid embodies several <a href="#hermetic-principles">Hermetic principles</a>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mentalism:</strong> Grid as vast neural network</li>
                <li><strong>Correspondence:</strong> Same structure across all scales</li>
                <li><strong>Vibration:</strong> Intent patterns create oscillations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding Through Analogy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3D Cellular Automaton:</strong> Like Conway's Game of Life in 3D</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Memory:</strong> Each cell stores and processes information</li>
                <li><strong>Neural Network:</strong> Cells communicate with neighbors</li>
                <li><strong>Spacetime Fabric:</strong> Grid provides the fabric of reality</li>
            </ul>

        <p>This grid model provides a discrete, quantized structure for the universe, allowing for the precise description of locations, interactions, and the transfer of intent between adjacent cells.</p>
