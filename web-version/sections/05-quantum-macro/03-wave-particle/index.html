    <h2>5.3 Wave-Particle Duality</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>There is no wave-particle duality in Synchronism. What physics calls "wave" and "particle" behavior are simply different sampling rates of the same continuously cycling intent pattern. The double-slit experiment perfectly demonstrates this - just like a CRT where you can see a smooth picture (wave-like) or a single scanning dot (particle-like) depending on your sampling rate, with the same electron beam cycling continuously.</p>
        
        <div class="key-concept">
            <h3>No Duality - Just Different Sampling Rates</h3>
            <p>In Synchronism, there is no wave-particle mystery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Always cycling:</strong> Intent patterns continuously cycle through their sequences</li>
                <li><strong>Slow sampling (wave):</strong> Sample over many cycles, see wave-like continuous behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Fast sampling (particle):</strong> Sample during single cycle moment, see particle-like discrete behavior</li>
                <li><strong>Same cycling pattern:</strong> Wave and particle are the same cycling process sampled differently</li>
                <li><strong>No "states":</strong> Pattern doesn't switch between wave and particle "states" - it's always cycling</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="wave-characteristics">
            <h3>Wave-like Behavior</h3>
            <p>When intent patterns exhibit wave characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spatial extension:</strong> Intent spreads across many grid cells</li>
                <li><strong>Interference:</strong> Multiple patterns can overlap and interfere</li>
                <li><strong>Diffraction:</strong> Patterns bend around obstacles in the grid</li>
                <li><strong>Wavelength:</strong> Distance between repeating pattern features</li>
                <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Rate of pattern oscillation in time</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Particle-like Behavior</h3>
            <p>When intent patterns exhibit particle characteristics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Localization:</strong> Intent concentrated in few grid cells</li>
                <li><strong>Discrete interactions:</strong> Transfers occur in quantized amounts</li>

            <h3>Measurement Timing Determines What You Witness</h3>
            <p>What you detect depends on when you sample the pattern:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wave-detecting instruments:</strong> Sample the pattern over multiple grid updates, seeing the continuous appearance</li>
                <li><strong>Particle-detecting instruments:</strong> Sample the pattern during a single grid update, seeing discrete behavior</li>
                <li><strong>No pattern influence:</strong> Your measurement doesn't change the pattern - it just determines which aspect you witness</li>
                <li><strong>Timing complementarity:</strong> Can't sample both continuously and discretely simultaneously</li>

            <h3>Double-Slit Shows Discrete-to-Continuous Emergence</h3>
            <p>The famous experiment demonstrates Synchronism perfectly:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discrete pattern updates:</strong> Intent pattern updates through grid cells one tick at a time</li>
                <li><strong>Both slits accessed:</strong> During each grid update, pattern can access multiple pathways</li>
                <li><strong>Interference emergence:</strong> Discrete updates through different paths create interference pattern</li>
                <li><strong>Detection screen timing:</strong> Screen samples pattern during specific grid updates, showing discrete hits</li>
                <li><strong>Path detection:</strong> Monitoring paths changes the timing of when you sample the pattern</li>

            <h3>Mathematical Unification</h3>
            <p>The wave-particle relationship is expressed through:</p>

                <li><strong>Intent wavelength:</strong> Distance over which intent pattern repeats</li>
                <li><strong>Intent momentum:</strong> Directed transfer rate through grid</li>

                <li><strong>Atomic scale:</strong> Wave properties become less apparent</li>

            <h3>No Paradox to Resolve</h3>
            <p>Synchronism shows there never was a paradox:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Natural emergence:</strong> Continuous appearance from discrete updates is how reality works everywhere</li>
                <li><strong>CRT analogy perfect:</strong> Just like TV images appear continuous from discrete scanning</li>
                <li><strong>No observer participation:</strong> Patterns cycle independently - observation is just synchronized sampling</li>
                <li><strong>Timing-dependent witnessing:</strong> What you see depends on when you sample, not on changing the pattern</li>
