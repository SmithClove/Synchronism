    <h2>8. Glossary of Terms</h2>
    <div class="section-content">
        <p>This glossary provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout the Synchronism framework. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.</p>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Abstraction</h3>
            <p>The process through which patterns at one scale give rise to simplified, higher-level patterns. Enables complexity management through MRH-appropriate simplification.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Cell</h3>
            <p>A single point in the universe grid where intent can be deposited. The fundamental discrete unit of space in Synchronism.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Coherence</h3>
            <p>The degree of pattern stability and harmony within a system. High coherence enables stable emergence and pattern persistence. Ethics is fundamentally a metric of coherence at each scale.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>CRT Analogy</h3>
            <p>The cathode ray tube comparison showing how different sampling rates (synchronization) create different perceptions of the same underlying process. Central to understanding quantum phenomena.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Cycling</h3>
            <p>The continuous process by which patterns repeat their sequences. Patterns never exist in static states - they are always cycling through their intent distributions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Decoherence</h3>
            <p>Loss of pattern synchronization, leading to classical behavior. At macro scales, overwhelm from numerous patterns prevents quantum coherence.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Emergence</h3>
            <p>The phenomenon where collective pattern interactions create new, higher-level patterns with properties not present in individual components.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Entanglement (Raster Entanglement)</h3>
            <p>In Synchronism, "entangled" particles are simply patterns that share synchronized cycling. Like two CRT screens showing identical images because they follow the same timing.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Field Effects</h3>
            <p>The influence patterns have on their local grid neighborhoods. Creates apparent forces and fields through statistical intent distributions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Grid</h3>
            <p>The fundamental discrete substrate of reality - a three-dimensional lattice of cells where intent patterns cycle. Space itself in Synchronism.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Intent</h3>
            <p>The fundamental "substance" of reality that cycles through grid cells. Not consciousness or will, but the basic unit of existence that creates all patterns.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Intent Transfer</h3>
            <p>The programmed movement of intent between adjacent cells from one time slice to the next. The mechanism underlying all motion and change.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Markov Blanket</h3>
            <p>The boundary between what is immediately relevant to a pattern and what can be statistically approximated. Defines the pattern's direct interaction sphere.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)</h3>
            <p>The scale at which analysis is most appropriate for a given system. Beyond this horizon, details can be abstracted without losing essential behavior.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Pattern</h3>
            <p>A stable cycling configuration of intent across grid cells. Everything that exists - particles, waves, objects, thoughts - is a pattern.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Planck Slice</h3>
            <p>One discrete tick of universal time. The cosmos processes one complete update of all intent transfers in each Planck-scale time unit.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Quantum Skip</h3>
            <p>The apparent discontinuous behavior in quantum mechanics, explained in Synchronism as the grid's discrete nature showing through at small scales.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Raster</h3>
            <p>The scanning pattern of a CRT, used as analogy for how consciousness samples reality. Different raster rates (synchronization) create different observed phenomena.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Saturation</h3>
            <p>The maximum intent a cell can hold. Excess intent must transfer to adjacent cells, creating pressure effects and apparent forces.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Single Observer</h3>
            <p>The foundational concept that all consciousness is one consciousness experiencing reality through multiple synchronized perspectives.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Sloshing</h3>
            <p>Colloquial term for intent movement between cells. Captures the fluid-like dynamics of intent transfer through the grid.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Spectral Existence</h3>
            <p>The concept that entities exist across a spectrum of pattern complexity, from simple (particles) to complex (conscious beings).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Superposition</h3>
            <p>Not a quantum state but the continuous cycling of patterns through their sequences. What appears as superposition is actually mid-cycle observation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Synchronism</h3>
            <p>The complete framework describing reality as cycling intent patterns witnessed through synchronization. Also the name of this groundbreaking model.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Synchronization</h3>
            <p>The act of consciousness aligning with specific pattern cycles to witness them. How observation occurs without affecting the patterns themselves.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Tension Field</h3>
            <p>The gradient of intent density across space. Creates effects like electromagnetic fields through differential intent distributions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Time Slice</h3>
            <p>One discrete moment in the universal timeline. Reality updates in Planck-scale increments, processing all intent transfers simultaneously.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Universe Grid</h3>
            <p>The complete three-dimensional lattice of cells that constitutes all of space. The fundamental substrate where all patterns cycle.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Wave Function</h3>
            <p>In Synchronism, not a probability distribution but a description of pattern cycling. No collapse occurs - only synchronization timing changes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="glossary-entry">
            <h3>Witnessing</h3>
            <p>The act of consciousness synchronizing with and experiencing pattern cycles. Passive observation that doesn't alter the patterns themselves.</p>
