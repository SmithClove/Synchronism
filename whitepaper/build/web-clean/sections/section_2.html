<h2 id="importance-of-perspective">2. Importance of Perspective</h2>
<p>The significance of perspective in understanding reality is
illustrated by the “Six Blind Men and the Elephant” analogy, an ancient
parable that highlights the limitations of individual perception and the
importance of holistic understanding.</p>
<p><strong>The Six Blind Men and the Elephant</strong></p>
<p>In this story, six blind men encounter an elephant for the first
time. Each man touches a different part of the elephant and describes
what he believes the elephant to be based on his limited experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>The man who feels the leg says the elephant is like a pillar</li>
<li>The one who touches the tail describes it as a rope</li>
<li>The man who feels the trunk thinks it’s like a tree branch</li>
<li>The one who touches the ear believes it’s like a hand fan</li>
<li>The man who feels the belly describes it as a wall</li>
<li>The one who touches the tusk thinks it’s like a solid pipe</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Insights from the Analogy</strong></p>
<p>This analogy illustrates several key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Different witnesses may experience only parts of a whole, leading to
incomplete or inaccurate conclusions</li>
<li>Consensus may not lead to coherence unless the perspectives involved
span sufficient scale diversity to reinforce a resonant whole</li>
<li>A comprehensive understanding requires both broadening one’s
perspective and gaining detailed knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Witness and Experience Framework</strong></p>
<p>However, each experience forms a model of perceived coherence within
the witness’s MRH—valid and complete within its bounds. While each man’s
understanding represents only a portion of the elephant, it may still be
both useful and adequate if the extent of interaction is constrained
enough to be fully accounted for by the model.</p>
<p>Synchronism introduces formal concepts of <strong>Witness</strong>
and <strong>Experience</strong>, defined as interactions of an entity
within its fractal scale and levels of abstraction. Through these
concepts Synchronism provides a formal framework for selecting a scale
and abstraction that balances resolution with coherence for the context
at hand, as a way of limiting complexity while including sufficient
level of detail for the desired level of accuracy.</p>
<p>Synchronism aims to provide a broader perspective that integrates
various viewpoints, allowing for a more complete understanding of
reality. It encourages stepping back to see the bigger picture while
also delving into the details of how the universe operates at its most
fundamental level.</p>
<p>Synchronism does not dismiss witness experience models as invalid.
Rather, it provides a perspective and a method for determining whether a
particular model or frame of reference is sufficient and optimal for the
analysis being contemplated, and adjusting the model for the task or
selecting a different one.</p>
