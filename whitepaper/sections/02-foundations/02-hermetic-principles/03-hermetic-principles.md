3.1 Mentalism: "The All is Mind; the Universe is Mental." 

• 
Synchronism: The universe is modeled as a vast array of interconnected "cells" that 
contain and transfer "intent," which can be seen as a form of mental energy or 
information. The model can also be viewed as a fundamental neural network, furthering 
the mentalism connection. 

3.2 Correspondence: "As above, so below; as below, so above." 

• 
Synchronism: The model proposes a fractal nature of reality, where patterns repeat at 
different scales, from the quantum to the cosmic. 

3.3 Vibration: "Nothing rests; everything moves and vibrates." 

• 
Synchronism: All phenomena are described as patterns of intent transfer, which can be 
seen as a form of vibration or oscillation at the most fundamental level. 

3.4 Polarity: "Everything is dual; everything has poles." 

• 
Synchronism: The concept of resonance and dissonance in the model reflects the 
principle of polarity, where entities can either reinforce or weaken each other's existence. 

3.5 Rhythm: "Everything flows, out and in; everything has its tides." 

• 
Synchronism: The model describes the universe as evolving through discrete "ticks" of 
time, creating a rhythmic progression of states. 

3.6 Cause and Effect: "Every cause has its effect; every effect has its cause." 

• 
Synchronism: The transfer of intent between cells and the resulting emergence of patterns 
and entities follows a causal chain, with each state informing the next. 

3.7 Gender: "Gender is in everything; everything has its masculine and feminine 
principles."

• 
Synchronism: The model incorporates this principle through the concept of a 
fundamental duality within entities, similar to the structure of Generative Adversarial 
Networks (GANs). This duality consists of a generative (masculine) principle that 
proposes new patterns or actions, and a discriminative (feminine) principle that evaluates 
and refines these proposals. This emergent property is seen as necessary for an entity's 
persistence and evolution, allowing for adaptation while maintaining internal coherence. 
It's present in all living things, not just those traditionally considered conscious, and 
reflects ancient concepts like yin and yang. In terms of intent transfer, the generative 
principle explores new intent distribution patterns, while the discriminative principle 
evaluates these patterns against existing stable configurations. Interpretations of this 
principle could be potentially extended to non-living entities, perhaps down to quantum 
scale and up to galactic scale. 

The generative-discriminative duality inherent in entities acts as a catalyst for emergence and 
evolution. The generative principle, akin to a creative force, constantly proposes new patterns 
and actions, pushing the boundaries of an entity's existence. The discriminative principle, acting 
as a discerning filter, evaluates these proposals against the backdrop of existing stable 
configurations. This dynamic interplay ensures that entities can adapt to their environment while 
maintaining internal coherence. In biological organisms, this duality manifests as the tension 
between mutation and natural selection. In social groups, it's reflected in the balance between 
innovation and tradition. The generative-discriminative duality, therefore, is not just a theoretical 
construct but a fundamental principle driving the complex dance of emergence and evolution 
across all scales of existence. 

The alignment of Synchronism with the Hermetic principles lays a philosophical foundation for 
the model's fundamental concepts. The following sections will delve into these concepts, 
demonstrating how they provide a mechanistic explanation for the Hermetic principles' 
manifestations in the universe.

4. Fundamental Concepts of Synchronism 

4.1 Universe as a Grid of Planck Cells 

Synchronism proposes that the universe can be modeled as an infinite three-dimensional grid of 
discrete cells. This concept provides a fundamental structure for understanding the nature of 
space and the interactions that occur within it. 

Key aspects of this grid model include: 

• 
Each cell in the grid is the size of a Planck length (approximately 1.616 × 10^-35 meters) 
in each dimension. The Planck length is theorized to be the smallest meaningful 
measurement of distance in the universe. 

• 
The grid extends infinitely in all directions, encompassing the entire universe. 

• 
Each cell contains a quantized amount of "intent," which can be thought of as a 
fundamental property or energy that drives all interactions and phenomena in the 
universe. 

• 
The amount of intent in each cell is limited by a saturation maximum, beyond which no 
more intent can be added to that cell. 

This grid model provides a discrete, quantized structure for the universe, allowing for the precise 
description of locations, interactions, and the transfer of intent between adjacent cells. 

4.2 Time as Planck-Timed Slices 

In the Synchronism model, time is not merely a backdrop or a dimension in which events unfold 
but is the fundamental substrate of reality itself. Time progresses as a series of discrete moments 
or "ticks," each representing the transition of the universe from one state to the next. This 
quantization of time provides not only a framework for understanding how the universe evolves 
but also suggests that time is the medium through which all phenomena are manifested, with 
each tick bringing forth a new slice of reality. 

This perspective emphasizes that time is the driving force behind all existence, with every entity 
and event being a ripple within this time substrate. The cessation of time, therefore, implies a 
cessation of all existence, as nothing can manifest without the passage of time. Time is the 
universal "Mind" that governs and sustains the universe's evolution, aligning with the Hermetic 
principle that "The All is Mind."Key aspects of this time model include: 

• 
Time advances in discrete units called "ticks," each corresponding to Planck time 
(approximately 5.39 × 10^-44 seconds). Planck time is theorized to be the smallest 
meaningful measurement of time in the universe. 

• 
The state of the entire universe at any given tick is referred to as a "slice." Each slice 
represents a complete snapshot of the intent distribution across all cells in the universe at 
that moment. 

• 
Each slice is fixed and unchanging, representing a static state of the universe.

• 
The state of each slice is informed by the intent distributions of all preceding states, 
establishing a causal chain throughout the history of the universe. 

This discrete time model allows for a precise description of how the universe evolves from one 
state to the next, with each tick representing a fundamental unit of change. 

4.3 Intent Transfer and Tension 

4.3.1 Intent as Reification of the Greater Force 

In Synchronism, the concept of "intent" serves as a reification of the abstract "greater force" that 
various belief systems posit as the underlying driver of reality. Reification is the process of 
assigning a concrete representation to an abstract concept, allowing for more tangible analysis 
and understanding. 

Understanding Reification: The Money Analogy 

To better grasp the concept of reification, consider the relationship between money and value: 

• 
Value is an abstract concept that can be difficult to quantify or transfer directly. 

• 
Money serves as a reification of value, providing a concrete way to measure, quantify, 
and transfer value. 

• 
While money represents value, it is not value itself; rather, it's a tool that allows us to 
work with the concept of value in practical ways. 

Similarly, in Synchronism: 

• 
The "greater force" (analogous to value) is an abstract concept that various belief systems 
attempt to describe. 

• 
Intent (analogous to money) serves as a concrete representation of this force, allowing us 
to model and analyze it. 

• 
Like money, intent is not the force itself, but a tool that enables us to work with and 
understand this fundamental aspect of reality. 

The concept of "intent" in Synchronism serves as a bridge between the abstract and the concrete. 
It reifies the elusive "greater force" often alluded to in various belief systems, providing a 
tangible framework for its exploration. While the "greater force" remains a philosophical or 
theological concept, "intent" allows us to model, measure, and analyze its manifestations within 
the universe. This reification, however, is not without its caveats. It's essential to remember that 
"intent" is a representation, a tool for understanding, not the force itself. The relationship 
between "intent" and the underlying force it signifies might be intricate and multifaceted, 
warranting further philosophical and scientific inquiry.
