## 2. Importance of Perspective

 The significance of perspective in understanding reality is illustrated by the "Six Blind Men and the Elephant" analogy, an ancient parable that highlights the limitations of individual perception and the importance of holistic understanding.

 ### The Six Blind Men and the Elephant

 In this story, six blind men encounter an elephant for the first time. Each man touches a different part of the elephant and describes what he believes the elephant to be based on his limited experience:

 - The man who feels the leg says the elephant is like a pillar
- The one who touches the tail describes it as a rope
- The man who feels the trunk thinks it's like a tree branch
- The one who touches the ear believes it's like a hand fan
- The man who feels the belly describes it as a wall
- The one who touches the tusk thinks it's like a solid pipe

 ### Key Insights from the Analogy

 This analogy illustrates several key points:

 - Different witnesses may experience only parts of a whole, leading to incomplete or inaccurate conclusions
- Consensus may not lead to coherence unless the perspectives involved span sufficient scale diversity to reinforce a resonant whole
- A comprehensive understanding requires both broadening one's perspective and gaining detailed knowledge

 ### Witness and Experience Framework

 However, each experience forms a model of perceived coherence within the witness's MRH—valid and complete within its bounds. While each man's understanding represents only a portion of the elephant, it may still be both useful and adequate if the extent of interaction is constrained enough to be fully accounted for by the model.

 Synchronism introduces formal concepts of **Witness** and **Experience**, defined as interactions of an entity within its fractal scale and levels of abstraction. Through these concepts Synchronism provides a formal framework for selecting a scale and abstraction that balances resolution with coherence for the context at hand, as a way of limiting complexity while including sufficient level of detail for the desired level of accuracy.

 Synchronism aims to provide a broader perspective that integrates various viewpoints, allowing for a more complete understanding of reality. It encourages stepping back to see the bigger picture while also delving into the details of how the universe operates at its most fundamental level.

 Synchronism does not dismiss witness experience models as invalid. Rather, it provides a perspective and a method for determining whether a particular model or frame of reference is sufficient and optimal for the analysis being contemplated, and adjusting the model for the task or selecting a different one.
