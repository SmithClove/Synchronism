# Example: Markov Blankets in a Neural Network

Consider a simplified neural network where each node represents a
neuron, and edges represent synaptic connections. The Markov blanket of
a particular neuron consists of its direct synaptic inputs (parents),
the neurons it directly influences (children), and other neurons that
share common synaptic targets (co-parents).

For example, a neuron involved in a feedback loop might have a Markov
blanket that includes both the upstream neurons that provide input and
the downstream neurons that it influences. This Markov blanket
effectively isolates the neuron from the rest of the network, defining
the boundary within which its behavior is fully determined by the local
interactions.

In a broader context, Markov blankets can be applied to define
boundaries in larger-scale systems, such as distinguishing between
different regions of the brain or between individual organisms within an
ecosystem. By applying Markov blankets, we can understand how distinct
entities maintain their identities while interacting with their
environments.
