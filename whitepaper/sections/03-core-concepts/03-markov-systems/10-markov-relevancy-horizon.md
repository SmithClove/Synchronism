# 9 Markov Relevancy Horizon

The Markov Relevancy Horizon is a concept in Synchronism that addresses
the issue of model selection and the appropriate scale of analysis for
different phenomena.

Key aspects of the Markov Relevancy Horizon include:

-   The relevance of a model depends on the scale of the phenomena being
    studied. Different scales may require different models or levels of
    detail to accurately describe and predict behavior.

-   Awareness of the full available scale is necessary to select the
    appropriate model. This means understanding both the microscopic and
    macroscopic aspects of a system to choose the right level of
    analysis.

-   The Markov Relevancy Horizon defines the boundary beyond which
    including additional information or complexity in a model does not
    significantly improve its predictive power or explanatory value.

-   This concept helps in determining the appropriate level of
    abstraction for studying different phenomena, balancing between
    oversimplification and unnecessary complexity.

The Markov Relevancy Horizon provides a guideline for selecting the most
appropriate model or scale of analysis for a given phenomenon, ensuring
that the chosen perspective is neither too narrow nor too broad.
