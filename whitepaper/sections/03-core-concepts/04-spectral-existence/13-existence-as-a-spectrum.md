# Existence as a Spectrum:

Traditional models often treat the existence of entities as a binary
state: something either exists or it does not. However, in Synchronism,
existence is viewed as a spectrum, where entities can exist more or less
strongly based on their interactions with other entities. These
interactions can be resonant, dissonant, or indifferent:

-   **Resonant Interactions:** When two entities interact resonantly,
    their intent patterns align, reinforcing each other's coherence and
    persistence. This mutual reinforcement strengthens their existence
    within each other's MRH, making them more prominent and stable
    within the system.

-   **Dissonant Interactions:** In dissonant interactions, the intent
    patterns of two entities are misaligned, leading to mutual
    disruption. This can weaken their coherence, causing them to
    decohere more rapidly. The degree of dissonance determines how
    quickly this decoherence occurs.

-   **Both Resonance and Dissonance are what would be termed
    'observation' in classical sense, as both entities are affected by
    each other and therefore are 'aware of', or 'experience' each
    other.**

-   **Indifferent Interactions:** Entities that interact indifferently
    have minimal or no impact on each other's coherence. Their intent
    patterns neither align nor misalign in any significant way, leading
    to little or no observable interaction. As a result, these entities
    may exist only weakly or be nearly invisible to one another within
    their MRH.

-   **An entity that interacts indifferently with some set of entities,
    and therefore exists weakly or not at all in their MRH, may interact
    resonantly or dissonantly with other entities, existing strongly in
    the other entities MRH.** Therefore, existence in Synchronism is
    entirely a matter of interactions.
