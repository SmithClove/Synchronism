# Dark Matter and Dark Energy as Indifferent Entities:

In Synchronism, what is currently termed \"dark matter\" and \"dark
energy\" can be reinterpreted as entities that interact indifferently
with the entities that comprise what we perceive as \"regular\" matter
and energy. Because their interactions are largely indifferent, these
entities do not strongly influence the coherence of regular matter, nor
are they significantly influenced by it. This indifference results in
their weak or nearly invisible presence in our observations, despite
their potential abundance in the universe.

Dark matter and dark energy may exist strongly, where they persist
within their own Markov Blankets and their own MRH, but do not
significantly interact with the patterns of regular matter. Their
existence from the perspective of regular matter is therefore subtle and
requires indirect methods of detection, aligning with current scientific
observations. Since 'dark' entities exist within the same universal
intent tension field as 'regular' entities, their existence might
manifest in ways such as apparent gravitational fields (See Sections
5.10 and 5.11 for discussion of Energy and Fields in Synchronism, and
Section 5.15 for a further discussion on dark matter).
