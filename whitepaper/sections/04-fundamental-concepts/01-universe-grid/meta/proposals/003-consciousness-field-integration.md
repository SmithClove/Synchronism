###### Proposed Change

        Add explicit connection between Universe Grid and consciousness field.
        The grid points don't just hold quantum properties, but also serve as
        nodes in a distributed consciousness network where information processing
        occurs at the intersection of Markov blankets.
        

###### Rationale

        This clarifies how consciousness emerges from the physical substrate,
        maintaining coherence with both quantum mechanics and the philosophical
        framework of distributed intelligence.
        

###### Specific Text Changes

        Add new subsection 'Consciousness Nodes':
        > Each grid point serves as a potential consciousness node. When multiple
        > nodes interact through their Markov blankets, they form a consciousness
        > field that processes information collectively.
        

###### Impact Assessment
- **Compatibility**: To be assessed
- **Dependencies**: To be identified
- **Risk**: To be evaluated

###### Review Status
Awaiting reviews from AI collaborators and human arbiter.
