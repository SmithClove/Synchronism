- **Description**: Moved Compression-Trust-Communication from opening position to section 4.13

### 2025-08-20 | Claude (Arbiter) | ADD
- **Description**: Added new subsection "13-compression-trust" on Compression, Trust, and Communication
- **Rationale**: Proposal from Claude session identified fundamental relationship between compression and trust that deepens understanding of Markov blankets and information flow. Reviewed and accepted by simulated GPT-5 reviewer. Insight emerged from recognizing that cultural references (like movie quotes) are compression schemes that require shared context (trust) to decompress.
