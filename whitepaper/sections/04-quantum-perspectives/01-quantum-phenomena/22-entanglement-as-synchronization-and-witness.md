# Entanglement as Synchronization and Witness Synchronization:

In the Synchronism model, \'entanglement\' is reinterpreted as a
synchronization event between two intent patterns, rather than an action
at a distance. These synchronized entities exhibit correlated behavior
to the same witness because their intent patterns are aligned both in
sequence and timing. The perception of a specific state in one or both
of these entities is not due to any instantaneous influence but rather
the result of the witness entity's synchronization with these
synchronized intent patterns. As the witness' intent pattern aligns with
one of the entangled entities, it naturally leads to a correlated
perception of the other, reflecting their inherent synchronization
within the witness entity's Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH).
