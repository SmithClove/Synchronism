# Macro-Decoherence Across Scales

Just as quantum decoherence describes the transition from quantum
superposition to classical states due to environmental interactions,
macro-decoherence refers to the breakdown of stable patterns at larger
scales. In Synchronism, this occurs when the internal coherence of a
pattern is disrupted by external forces or when the pattern\'s
complexity surpasses the system\'s capacity to maintain internal
alignment.

Macro-decoherence is particularly relevant in scenarios where high
velocity or acceleration challenges a pattern\'s stability. As a pattern
approaches the speed of light, for instance, the increased velocity can
lead to a slowing of internal resonances (as described in Section 5.7)
and an eventual breakdown of the pattern\'s coherence. This breakdown
mirrors the way quantum systems lose their coherence, but it occurs on a
much larger scale, affecting macroscopic entities and complex systems.

This concept reinforces the idea that principles governing quantum
behavior are not confined to the microscopic world but extend across all
scales. The fractal nature of reality, as posited by Synchronism,
ensures that similar processes and dynamics manifest at every level of
existence, from the quantum to the cosmic.

By understanding macro-decoherence, we gain insight into the conditions
under which complex systems may lose stability, offering potential
applications in fields ranging from high-energy physics to the study of
complex biological systems.
