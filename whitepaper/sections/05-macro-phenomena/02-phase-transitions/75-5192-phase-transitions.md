# 5.19.2 Phase Transitions

Phase transitions represent significant changes in the coherence and
interaction modes of intent patterns within a material.

*Critical Temperature: *

The temperature at which a phase transition occurs is given by:

T_crit = (ℏ/k_B) \* ù_intent

Where ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, k_B is Boltzmann\'s constant,
and ù_intent represents the characteristic frequency of the intent
transfer wave.

*Order Parameter: *

We can define an order parameter Ö(r, t, T) to describe the degree of
order in the system:

Ö(r, t, T) = f(I(r, t, T), ∇I(r, t, T))

Where I(r, t, T) is the intent field and f is a function that captures
the local alignment of intent patterns.

*Dynamics of Phase Transitions: *

The time evolution of the order parameter can be described by a
time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation:

∂Ö/∂t = -Ã(äF/äÖ) + ç(r, t)

Where Ã is a kinetic coefficient, F is the free energy functional, and
ç(r, t) represents thermal fluctuations.
