# 10 Energy in Synchronism

In Synchronism, energy is understood as the magnitude of intent transfer
over a given number of Planck ticks. This conceptualization ties
directly into the framework of intent quantization, coherence, and
decoherence, providing a unified explanation for various forms of
energy---whether at the quantum, atomic, molecular, or macroscopic
scale.
