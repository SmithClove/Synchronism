## 5.19 Energy Refinement

 Energy refinement in Synchronism describes the progressive organization of cycling intent patterns into increasingly coherent, resonant, and information-dense forms. This process represents the evolutionary optimization of resonance alignment, minimizing dissonance and enabling sustained pattern evolution.

**Refinement as Resonance Optimization**

 Energy refinement involves:

 - **Resonance alignment:** Patterns aligning better with surrounding structures, minimizing dissonance
- **Coherence optimization:** Patterns maintaining stability through synchronized cycling
- **Information density:** Greater information content achieved through resonant pattern organization
- **Intent-directed evolution:** Patterns developing specific capabilities through coherent organization

**Thermodynamic Aspects**

 - **Entropy as alignment gradient:** Entropy gradients are opportunities for resonance migration—refined patterns surf energy flows instead of being scattered
- **Free energy as resonance accessibility:** Free energy is not just energy 'available' but energy in resonance-accessible form, capable of intent transfer
- **Resonant dissipative structures:** Organized patterns maintained through harmonization with local intent flows
- **Coherence-entropy mediation:** Entropy doesn't erase coherence—it redirects it through resonance pathways

**Synchronism View of Refinement**

 In Synchronism, energy refinement represents:

 - **Intent pattern evolution:** Cycling intent patterns becoming increasingly resonant and coherent
- **Resonance domain expansion:** Refinement increases the domain of resonance, reduces dissonant waste, and renders indifferent environments progressively interactive
