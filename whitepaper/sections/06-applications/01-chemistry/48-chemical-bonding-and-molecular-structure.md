# Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure

Chemical bonds represent stable, resonant patterns of intent transfer
between atoms. The strength and nature of these bonds correspond to the
coherence and frequency of these patterns. For example:

-   Covalent bonds: High-frequency, localized intent transfer patterns

-   Ionic bonds: Lower-frequency, more distributed intent patterns

-   Hydrogen bonds: Weaker, more flexible intent transfer patterns

Molecular structure emerges from the complex interplay of these bonding
patterns, creating stable configurations of intent transfer at the
atomic and molecular scales.
