# Chemical Reactions

Chemical reactions occur when the intent transfer patterns of reactant
molecules interact in ways that lead to reorganization. This process can
be understood as a form of resonance between the intent patterns of the
reactants, resulting in new, stable configurations (products).

The activation energy of a reaction represents the threshold of intent
transfer required to destabilize existing patterns sufficiently for
reorganization to occur. This concept aligns with the idea of
macro-decoherence in Synchronism, where existing patterns break down
before new ones can form.
