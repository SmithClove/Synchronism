# 5.20.2 Cognitive Coherence

Cognitive processes represent even more complex and dynamic intent
pattern interactions.

*Cognitive Decoherence Rate: *

The rate at which cognitive processes lose coherence can be expressed
as:

ë_cognition = k_c \* T \* (ù_cognition / ù_intent)

Where k_c is a coupling constant, T is temperature, ù_cognition is the
frequency of cognitive processes, and ù_intent is the baseline frequency
of intent patterns.

*Cognitive Coherence Function: *

We can define a coherence function specific to cognitive processes:

C_cog(r, t, T) = exp(-ë_cognition \* t) \* f(I_neural(r, t))

Where f(I_neural) is a function that captures the coherence of neural
intent patterns.
