# Galaxy Rotation Curves

**Observation:** The outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than
expected based on visible matter, indicating the presence of unseen
mass, traditionally attributed to dark matter.

**Synchronism Interpretation:** Black holes, as gravitational entities,
might contribute to the mass responsible for these unexpected rotation
curves. Within Synchronism, this would suggest that the gravitational
effects attributed to dark matter are, at least in part, due to numerous
small black holes dispersed throughout galaxies, influencing their
rotation through the tension field.
