# High-Speed Travel and Space Exploration:

The probabilistic speed limits identified in Synchronism could inform
the design of spacecraft and other high-speed vehicles, particularly
when considering the effects of internal coherence on mission success.
Understanding how complex onboard systems might be affected by
relativistic speeds could lead to more robust designs that mitigate the
risks of decoherence.
