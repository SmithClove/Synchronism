# 5.17.2 Reinterpreting Maxwell\'s Equations

Maxwell\'s equations, fundamental to classical electromagnetism, can be
reframed within Synchronism as descriptions of intent pattern dynamics:

*Gauss\'s Law for Electricity:*

The net flow of intent associated with electric charge patterns through
a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge density. This
suggests electric charge is a specific resonant intent pattern creating
localized distortions in the tension field.

*Gauss\'s Law for Magnetism: *

The net flow of intent associated with magnetic field patterns through a
closed surface is zero, indicating magnetic fields arise from dynamic
interplays of intent patterns rather than isolated magnetic charges.

*Faraday\'s Law of Induction: *

Changes in the coherence or distribution of intent patterns associated
with magnetic fields induce corresponding changes in electric field
intent patterns within closed loops.

*Amp√®re\'s Circuital Law: *

The circulation of intent patterns associated with magnetic fields
around a closed loop is proportional to the flow of intent associated
with electric current plus the rate of change of intent flow associated
with electric fields through the loop.
