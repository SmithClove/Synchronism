# 5.17.3 Electromagnetic Interactions and Material Properties

The concepts of resonance, dissonance, and indifference introduced in
our discussion of permeability apply directly to electromagnetic
phenomena:

*Conductivity: *

High resonance between electron intent patterns and material intent
patterns, allowing for easy flow of electric current.

*Insulation: *

High dissonance between electron intent patterns and material intent
patterns, impeding electric current flow.

*Electromagnetic Wave Propagation: *

The speed of light in different media can be understood as the degree of
indifference between the intent patterns of the electromagnetic wave and
the material.

*Reflection and Refraction: *

Arise from varying degrees of resonance and dissonance at material
interfaces, causing changes in the propagation of electromagnetic intent
patterns.

This framework provides a unified understanding of electromagnetic
phenomena within the Synchronism model, connecting microscopic intent
pattern interactions to macroscopic observable effects.
