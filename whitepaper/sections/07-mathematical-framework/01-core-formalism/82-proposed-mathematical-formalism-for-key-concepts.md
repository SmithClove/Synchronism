# Proposed Mathematical Formalism for Key Concepts

Appendix A provides the mathematical formalism underlying the key
concepts of Synchronism. This appendix aims to bridge the conceptual
framework presented in the main text with rigorous quantitative
analysis. By formalizing these ideas mathematically, we lay the
groundwork for potential empirical testing and further theoretical
development of the Synchronism model. Readers are encouraged to refer
back to the relevant sections in the main text for conceptual
explanations of the mathematical constructs presented here.

NOTE: the individual sections in this appendix have been proposed
separately by different authors at different times. As a result, there
may be some inconsistencies between them, as well as issues such as use
of the same symbol with different meanings from one section to the next.
We are aware of some specific cases, and are in the process of cleaning
up and resolving these issues. Readers are invited to critique and
propose changes/clarifications, and to contribute to the evolution of
the document.

For conceptual background on Intent and Intent Transfer, see Section 4.3
in the main text. Here we introduce some proposed analytical tools for
analyzing Intent Transfer and its implications on other aspects of the
Synchronism model.
