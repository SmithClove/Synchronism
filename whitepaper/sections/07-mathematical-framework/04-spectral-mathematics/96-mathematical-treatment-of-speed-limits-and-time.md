# 3 Mathematical Treatment of Speed Limits and Time Dilation

The concepts of Speed Limits and Time Dilation are introduced in Section
5.7. Here we explore how Synchronism integrates these mainstream
phenomena into the new model.

To quantify the concepts of speed limits and time dilation in
Synchronism, we introduce the following mathematical framework:
