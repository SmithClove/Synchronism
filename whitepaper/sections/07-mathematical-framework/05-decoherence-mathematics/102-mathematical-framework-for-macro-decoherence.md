# 4 Mathematical Framework for Macro-Decoherence

In Synchronism, the concept of macro-decoherence becomes particularly
important when examining the behavior of complex systems under
high-speed conditions. As a pattern or entity accelerates towards the
speed of light, the internal processes that maintain its coherence face
increasing challenges. The internal alignment, or coherence, of the
pattern\'s intent distribution may begin to falter, leading to a gradual
loss of stability.

Macro-Decoherence is discussed in Section 5.8 of the main text.
