# Complexity-Dependent Decoherence Rate

To model macro-decoherence, we introduce a decoherence rate ë(r,t),
which depends on the complexity of the pattern and its velocity. This
rate quantifies the likelihood of coherence loss in a given pattern at
position r and time t.

Let C(r,t) be the complexity function and v(r,t) the velocity vector as
previously defined. We define the decoherence rate as:

ë(r,t) = â\|v(r,t)\|C(r,t)

where â is a proportionality constant that determines the sensitivity of
the pattern\'s coherence to its complexity and velocity. The decoherence
rate increases with both the speed and complexity of the pattern,
reflecting the increased likelihood of coherence loss at higher
velocities or with greater complexity.
