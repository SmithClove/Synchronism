# Decoherence Probability

The probability of a pattern experiencing decoherence during a time
interval Ät can be expressed as:

P_decohere(r,t) = 1 - exp(-ë(r,t)Ät)

This expression is derived from the exponential decay model, where the
likelihood of decoherence increases over time as the pattern is
subjected to the influences of velocity and complexity.
