# Modification to the Coherence Function

The coherence function C(r,t), initially defined to measure the degree
of alignment within a pattern, is now modified to account for
macro-decoherence:

C_eff(r,t) = C(r,t) · exp(-ë(r,t)Ät)

Here, C_eff(r,t) represents the effective coherence after accounting for
the decoherence effect. As decoherence progresses, the effective
coherence diminishes, reflecting the breakdown of internal alignment
within the pattern.
