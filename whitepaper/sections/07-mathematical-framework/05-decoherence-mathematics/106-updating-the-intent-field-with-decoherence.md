# Updating the Intent Field with Decoherence

The updating rule for the intent field now incorporates the decoherence
factor:

I(r,t + Ät) = I(r,t) + ÓT(r,t)·Ät/ã(r,t) · exp(-ë(r,t)Ät) +
á·C_eff(r,t)·Ät/ã(r,t)

This rule updates the intent field while considering the effects of time
dilation and macro-decoherence. The term exp(-ë(r,t)Ät) effectively
reduces the contribution of coherence as decoherence progresses, leading
to a gradual loss of structure and alignment within the pattern.
