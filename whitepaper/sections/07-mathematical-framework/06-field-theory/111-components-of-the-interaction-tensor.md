# 3 Components of the Interaction Tensor

The interaction tensor Î can be decomposed into three components that
correspond to the types of interaction effects:

-   **Î1 (Alignment Component)**: Represents the degree of phase shift
    or temporal alignment experienced by the entity. It describes
    interactions that adjust the resonant timing of intent patterns
    without altering their spatial configuration.

    -   **Example**: A planet\'s orbit undergoing a small change in
        timing due to the gravitational influence of nearby bodies.

-   Î2 (Displacement Component)**: Represents the degree of spatial
    translation or rotation experienced by the entity. It describes
    interactions that alter the position or orientation of the entity
    without changing its internal coherence.**

    -   **Example**: A comet's trajectory being altered as it passes
        near a massive object, with no change to its internal structure.

-   **Î3 (Alteration Component)**: Represents the degree of change in
    coherence or quantity of intent. This component describes
    interactions that modify the entity's structure, leading to changes
    in function or even its existence.

    -   **Example**: A star collapsing into a black hole, where the
        entity undergoes extreme alteration, leading to a new form.
