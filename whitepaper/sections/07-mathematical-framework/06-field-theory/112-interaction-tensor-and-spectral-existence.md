# 4 Interaction Tensor and Spectral Existence

The interaction tensor can also be linked to the concept of spectral
existence. Entities that primarily experience alignment interactions
(Î1) tend to exhibit strong spectral existence, maintaining coherence
over time. Entities that undergo significant alteration (Î3) are more
likely to experience decoherence, leading to diminished spectral
existence.

-   **Example**: Dark matter entities may experience mostly alignment
    and displacement interactions (Î1 and Î2) with regular matter, while
    black holes might undergo significant alteration during formation,
    affecting their spectral existence.
