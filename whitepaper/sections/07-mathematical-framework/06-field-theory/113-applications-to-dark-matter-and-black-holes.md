# 5 Applications to Dark Matter and Black Holes

The interaction tensor Î provides a potential framework for
understanding the gravitational interactions between dark matter, black
holes, and regular matter:

-   **Î2 (Displacement)** could explain the gravitational lensing
    effects caused by dark matter, where the trajectory of light is
    displaced without a direct electromagnetic interaction.

-   **Î1 (Alignment)** could describe the subtle gravitational
    influences dark matter entities exert on galactic structures,
    maintaining coherence within their own Markov Relevancy Horizons.

This mathematical framework not only provides a method for quantifying
interactions but also serves as a tool for exploring the behavior of
complex systems across fractal scales
