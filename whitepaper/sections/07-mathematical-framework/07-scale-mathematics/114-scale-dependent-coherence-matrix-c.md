# Scale-Dependent Coherence Matrix (C)

The coherence matrix `C` quantifies the influence of coherence on intent
transfer during interactions. To incorporate scale dependence, we can
express it as:

    C(r, t, s) = f_s(d(r, r'), C_1(r, t, s), C_2(r', t, s))

where:

-   `C(r, t, s)`: Coherence matrix at position `r`, time `t`, and scale
    `s`.

-   `f_s`: A scale-dependent function capturing the relationship between
    coherence and intent transfer at scale `s`.

-   `d(r, r')`: Distance between interacting entities at positions `r`
    and `r'`.

-   `C_1(r, t, s)` and `C_2(r', t, s)`: Coherence levels of the
    interacting entities at positions `r` and `r'` and scale `s`.

**Example:**

At the atomic scale (`s = atomic`), `f_s` could be modeled as:

    f_atomic(d, C_1, C_2) = (C_1 * C_2) / (1 + (d / d_0)^2) 

where `d_0` is a characteristic atomic interaction distance. This
function reflects that coherence enhances intent transfer, especially at
shorter distances.
