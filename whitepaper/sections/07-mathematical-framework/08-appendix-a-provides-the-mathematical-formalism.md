# Appendix A provides the mathematical formalism underlying the key concepts of Synchronism

This appendix aims to bridge the conceptual framework presented in the main text with rigorous 
quantitative analysis. By formalizing these ideas mathematically, we lay the groundwork for 
potential empirical testing and further theoretical development of the Synchronism model. 
Readers are encouraged to refer back to the relevant sections in the main text for conceptual 
explanations of the mathematical constructs presented here.
