## 8. Glossary of Terms

 This glossary provides clear definitions of key terms used throughout the Synchronism framework. Terms are organized alphabetically for easy reference.

**Abstraction**

 The process through which patterns at one scale give rise to simplified, higher-level patterns. Enables complexity management through MRH-appropriate simplification.

**Cell**

 A single point in the universe grid where intent can be deposited. The fundamental discrete unit of space in Synchronism.

**Coherence**

 The degree of pattern stability and harmony within a system. High coherence enables stable emergence and pattern persistence. Ethics is fundamentally a metric of coherence at each scale.

**CRT Analogy**

 The cathode ray tube comparison showing how different sampling rates (synchronization) create different perceptions of the same underlying process. Central to understanding quantum phenomena.

**Cycling**

 The continuous process by which patterns repeat their sequences. Patterns never exist in static states - they are always cycling through their intent distributions.

**Decoherence**

 Loss of pattern synchronization, leading to classical behavior. At macro scales, overwhelm from numerous patterns prevents quantum coherence.

**Emergence**

 The phenomenon where collective pattern interactions create new, higher-level patterns with properties not present in individual components.

**Entanglement (Raster Entanglement)**

 In Synchronism, "entangled" particles are simply patterns that share synchronized cycling. Like two CRT screens showing identical images because they follow the same timing.

**Field Effects**

 The influence patterns have on their local grid neighborhoods. Creates apparent forces and fields through statistical intent distributions.

**Grid**

 The fundamental discrete substrate of reality - a three-dimensional lattice of cells where intent patterns cycle. Space itself in Synchronism.

**Intent**

 The fundamental "substance" of reality that cycles through grid cells. Not consciousness or will, but the basic unit of existence that creates all patterns.

**Intent Transfer**

 The programmed movement of intent between adjacent cells from one time slice to the next. The mechanism underlying all motion and change.

**Markov Blanket**

 The boundary between what is immediately relevant to a pattern and what can be statistically approximated. Defines the pattern's direct interaction sphere.

**Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH)**

 The scale at which analysis is most appropriate for a given system. Beyond this horizon, details can be abstracted without losing essential behavior.

**Pattern**

 A stable cycling configuration of intent across grid cells. Everything that exists - particles, waves, objects, thoughts - is a pattern.

**Planck Slice**

 One discrete tick of universal time. The cosmos processes one complete update of all intent transfers in each Planck-scale time unit.

**Quantum Skip**

 The apparent discontinuous behavior in quantum mechanics, explained in Synchronism as the grid's discrete nature showing through at small scales.

**Raster**

 The scanning pattern of a CRT, used as analogy for how consciousness samples reality. Different raster rates (synchronization) create different observed phenomena.

**Saturation**

 The maximum intent a cell can hold. Excess intent must transfer to adjacent cells, creating pressure effects and apparent forces.

**Single Observer**

 The foundational concept that all consciousness is one consciousness experiencing reality through multiple synchronized perspectives.

**Sloshing**

 Colloquial term for intent movement between cells. Captures the fluid-like dynamics of intent transfer through the grid.

**Spectral Existence**

 The concept that entities exist across a spectrum of pattern complexity, from simple (particles) to complex (conscious beings).

**Superposition**

 Not a quantum state but the continuous cycling of patterns through their sequences. What appears as superposition is actually mid-cycle observation.

**Synchronism**

 The complete framework describing reality as cycling intent patterns witnessed through synchronization. Also the name of this groundbreaking model.

**Synchronization**

 The act of consciousness aligning with specific pattern cycles to witness them. How observation occurs without affecting the patterns themselves.

**Tension Field**

 The gradient of intent density across space. Creates effects like electromagnetic fields through differential intent distributions.

**Time Slice**

 One discrete moment in the universal timeline. Reality updates in Planck-scale increments, processing all intent transfers simultaneously.

**Universe Grid**

 The complete three-dimensional lattice of cells that constitutes all of space. The fundamental substrate where all patterns cycle.

**Wave Function**

 In Synchronism, not a probability distribution but a description of pattern cycling. No collapse occurs - only synchronization timing changes.

**Witnessing**

 The act of consciousness synchronizing with and experiencing pattern cycles. Passive observation that doesn't alter the patterns themselves.
