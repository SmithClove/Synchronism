# Introduction

In the Synchronism framework, entities are understood to interact
through various modes, including resonance, dissonance, and
indifference. A particularly intriguing proposition is the
interpretation of black holes as a form of dark matter, primarily
interacting with regular matter via gravitational forces. This concept
opens the door to a novel understanding of several cosmic phenomena and
anomalies, suggesting that black holes and dark matter might be part of
a broader spectrum of gravitationally interacting entities. This section
explores this idea and proposes how Synchronism can provide a deeper
understanding of these phenomena.
