# Intent Quantization

While the underlying force that intent represents may or may not be
quantized, we define intent itself as a quantized value for clarity and
computational efficiency. Initially, we propose four possible intent
levels (0-3), representable by a 2-bit integer per cell. This
quantization allows for discrete modeling of intent distribution and
transfer, enabling more straightforward analysis and simulation of the
Synchronism model.

A mathematical treatment of Intent Quantization is proposed in Appendix
A.6.
