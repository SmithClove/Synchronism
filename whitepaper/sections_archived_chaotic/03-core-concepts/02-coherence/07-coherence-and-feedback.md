# 7 Coherence and Feedback

Coherence and feedback are important concepts in Synchronism that
describe how entities maintain their structure and how they influence
their environment and each other.

Key aspects of coherence and feedback include:

-   Coherence measures the extent to which entities act as a unified
    group. It represents the degree of internal consistency and
    coordination within a pattern of intent distribution.

-   Higher coherence indicates a more stable and robust entity, capable
    of maintaining its structure in the face of external influences.

-   Feedback refers to the effects that an entity\'s actions or
    existence have on its local environment and on itself.

-   Positive feedback can reinforce and strengthen an entity\'s
    coherence, while negative feedback can weaken or destabilize it.

-   The interplay between coherence and feedback creates complex
    dynamics, where entities can evolve, adapt, and potentially give
    rise to new, emergent patterns.

These concepts help explain how stable structures can persist in the
universe and how they can change and evolve over time.

##### 4.7.1 Introduction to Coherence in Synchronism

Coherence in Synchronism refers to the degree of alignment and
coordinated behavior among cells or entities within the model. It plays
a crucial role in the emergence of stable patterns and the formation of
higher-order structures.

##### 4.7.2 Mathematical Representation of Coherence

##### Refer to Appendix A.2 for the proposed mathematical treatments of key aspects of Coherence:

-   Coherence Function

-   Relationship to Tension Field

-   Scale-Dependent Coherence Function

-   Macro-Decoherence Across Scales

-   Modified Updating Rules

-   Coherence Correlation Function

-   Order Parameter

##### 4.7.3 Implications and Applications

The mathematical framework for coherence in Synchronism provides tools
for:

-   Analyzing the stability and propagation of coherent patterns

-   Studying the emergence of higher-order structures

-   Investigating the role of coherence in information processing and
    adaptation

-   Exploring analogies with physical systems exhibiting coherent
    behavior

This framework can be applied to various fields, including:

-   Physics: Understanding phase transitions and collective phenomena

-   Biology: Modeling coherent behavior in ecosystems and organisms

-   Social Sciences: Analyzing the emergence of social norms and
    collective behaviors

-   Cognitive Science: Investigating the role of neural coherence in
    consciousness and cognition
