# 8 Markov Blankets and Scale Boundaries

The concept of Markov blankets, borrowed from probability theory and
statistics, is used in Synchronism to define boundaries between
different scales of existence and between distinct entities.

Key aspects of Markov blankets and scale boundaries in Synchronism
include:

-   A Markov blanket is a set of nodes in a network that separates an
    entity from its environment in terms of information flow.

-   In Synchronism, Markov blankets help define the boundaries of
    entities at various scales, from subatomic particles to complex
    organisms and even larger cosmic structures.

-   These blankets provide insight into the self-organizational aspects
    of emergence, showing how distinct entities can form and maintain
    their boundaries within the larger fabric of the universe.

-   Scale boundaries, defined by Markov blankets, help explain how
    different levels of reality (e.g., quantum, molecular, biological,
    social) can have distinct properties and behaviors while still being
    interconnected.

The use of Markov blankets in Synchronism provides a mathematical and
conceptual tool for understanding how distinct entities and scales of
reality can emerge from the underlying fabric of intent distribution.
