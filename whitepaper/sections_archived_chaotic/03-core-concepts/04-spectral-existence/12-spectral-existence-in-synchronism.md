# 10 Spectral Existence in Synchronism

In Synchronism, the existence of entities is not a binary state but a
spectral phenomenon. Entities do not simply \"exist\" or \"not exist\";
rather, they manifest varying degrees of existence based on their
interactions with other entities within their Markov Relevancy Horizon
(MRH). Fundamentally, it is a way to reconcile individual entity
experience with the single-observer model of Synchronism. To maintain
the distinction between the single observer and the entities embodied
therein, Synchronism refers to all entities at all fractal scales as
"witnesses". A witness is any entity, anywhere on the fractal scale from
quantum to galactic, that experiences interactions with other entities
within its MRH. In this perspective, the existence of a witness is
defined by its experiences.

The key to understanding spectral existence is the interaction modes
between entities which were introduced in Section 4.6 -- Resonance,
Dissonance and Indifference. The extent to which one entity exists in
the frame of reference of another is determined by the modes of their
interaction.

This section explores how entities experience and interact with each
other in Synchronism, and how these interactions determine their
persistence and influence within the framework.
