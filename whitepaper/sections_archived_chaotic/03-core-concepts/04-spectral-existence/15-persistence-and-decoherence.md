# Persistence and Decoherence:

The strength of an entity\'s existence within its MRH is directly
related to its persistence. An entity that exists strongly within its
Markov Blanket persists in a recognizable form over a long sequence of
Planck ticks. This persistence is a result of resonant interactions with
other entities, which maintain its coherence.

Conversely, entities that exist weakly are more prone to decoherence.
These entities may slowly or rapidly lose their recognizable form,
depending on the degree of dissonance in their interactions. As they
decohere, they gradually fade from existence within the MRH of the
entities they interact with, until they no longer have a significant
impact.

By reinterpreting existence as a spectrum rather than a binary state,
Synchronism offers a more nuanced understanding of how entities persist,
interact, and influence one another. This spectral existence framework
not only explains the varied persistence of entities but also provides a
novel lens through which to view phenomena like dark matter and dark
energy. In this model, all entities \"exist\" to varying degrees based
on their interactions, and their persistence or decoherence is a natural
consequence of these dynamic relationships.
