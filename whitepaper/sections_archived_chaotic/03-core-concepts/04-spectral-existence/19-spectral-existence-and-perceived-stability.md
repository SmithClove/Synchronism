# Spectral Existence and Perceived Stability:

In the analogy above, nothing about the CRT changed. It continued to
display the same image by the same mechanism. However, changing the
witness' resonance with the mechanism produced dramatically different
experience, altering the apparent nature of the image's existence too
the witness.

The CRT analogy illustrates how entities within the Synchronism
framework exist on a spectrum of existence, rather than in a binary
state. Just as the rapid movement of the electron beam creates the
illusion of a stable image on the screen, entities in Synchronism
resonate with each other based on the alignment of their intent
patterns. The strength of their perceived existence is determined by how
resonantly they interact with their environment and each other, leading
to varying degrees of experience and interaction. This spectral nature
of existence provides a framework for understanding why quantum effects,
such as superposition and entanglement, manifest differently depending
on the witness' scale, timing, and method of interaction.

### 

-   Traditional perspective: in quantum mechanics, particles can exist
    in a superposition of states until "observed".

-   CRT Analogy: Different \"refresh rates\" of interaction lead to
    perceived superposition. If witnessed at a rate slower than the
    electron beam\'s movement, multiple positions appear to exist
    simultaneously.

-   Synchronism Interpretation: The apparent superposition is a result
    of witnessing intent distributions at a scale or rate that doesn\'t
    capture the full dynamics of the system.
