# Superposition as Spectral Existence:

In the Synchronism model, quantum superposition is interpreted as an
entity cycling through its sequence of intent distribution patterns,
each representing a possible state. The witness' synchronization with
one of these states---where their intent patterns resonate more strongly
with it---leads to the perception of that state as the \'collapsed\'
outcome. The other sequential states, with which the witness' intent
does not resonate, are not perceived or experienced though they still
occur.

A key aspect of spectral existence in Synchronism is that it is
existence is intertwined with interaction. It is a resonant phenomenon,
and one or both interacting entities may be altered by the experience of
interaction. The alteration may be limited, preserving the total intent
of the entity while potentially changing the timing or location of the
intent pattern in space, or it may be constructive or destructive to the
entity, substantially changing its resonant intent pattern.

Synchronism formally addresses these concepts by classifying entity
interactions as resonant, dissonant, and indifferent.

This process illustrates how a witness entity's experience is not just a
passive act but an active synchronization event, aligning the witness
entity with specific aspects of the witnessed entity\'s spectral
existence within the Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH).

### 

-   Traditional perspective: quantum entities can exhibit both wave-like
    and particle-like properties depending on the experiment.

-   CRT Analogy: The apparent nature of the electron beam depends on the
    method of interaction. Viewed rapidly, it appears as a moving
    particle; viewed slowly, it seems to be a wave-like distribution
    across the screen.

-   Synchronism Interpretation: The wave-like or particle-like nature of
    an entity is a result of how its intent distribution pattern
    interacts with the interaction method.
