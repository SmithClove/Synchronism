# Wave-Particle Duality and Spectral Existence:

The wave-particle duality experienced in quantum entities is a
manifestation of the spectral nature of existence in Synchronism. The
form in which an entity is perceived---whether as a wave or a
particle---is determined by the witness' synchronization with the
entity\'s intent pattern. When the witness' method of interaction aligns
with the broader spectrum of the entity\'s intent patterns, it manifests
as a wave. Conversely, when the interaction is more focused or
localized, the entity appears as a discrete particle. This duality
reflects the spectrum of existence within Synchronism, where entities
appear to dynamically shift between different modes of being depending
on their interaction with the witness entity.

### 

-   Traditional perspective: entangled particles can instantly affect
    each other\'s states, regardless of distance.

-   CRT Analogy: Two CRTs with synchronized electron beams would show
    correlated behavior without direct communication, since
    synchronizing the interaction with one of the 'entangled' CRTs also
    causes synchronization with the other.

-   Synchronism Interpretation: Entanglement is a result of synchronized
    intent distribution patterns, rather than action at a distance.
