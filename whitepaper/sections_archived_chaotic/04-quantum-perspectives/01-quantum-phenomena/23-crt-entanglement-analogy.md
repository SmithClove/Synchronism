# CRT Entanglement Analogy:

Imagine two CRTs with perfectly synchronized electron beams. When a
witness synchronizes their interaction with one of these \'entangled\'
CRTs, it naturally causes synchronization with the other, leading to
correlated experienced behavior, without any direct communication. This
analogy highlights that the synchronization experienced in entanglement
is not due to any instantaneous influence between the entities but
rather due to their inherent synchronization and the witness' role in
perceiving this correlation.
