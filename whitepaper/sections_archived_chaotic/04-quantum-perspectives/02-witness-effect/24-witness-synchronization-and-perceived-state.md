# Witness Synchronization and Perceived State:

In Synchronism, when a witness interacts with one of these synchronized
entities, the witness' own intent patterns resonate with specific
aspects of the witnessed entity\'s intent distribution. While the
witnessed entity continues to resonate through its internal sequence of
intent distributions, the witness' synchronization with certain
patterns, and dissonance or indifference with others, leads to the
perception of a specific \'snapshot\' of the witnessed intent
distribution. This process is what Synchronism interprets as the
mechanism behind the apparent \'wave function collapse\' during
interaction.

The witness' resonance with a particular state causes that state to
exist more strongly within the witness' Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH),
giving rise to the perception that this state is the \'collapsed\'
reality.
