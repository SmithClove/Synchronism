# Speed Limits and Time Dilation

Time dilation, proposed by Einstein as part of his theory of relativity,
is a useful analytical tool in accounting for effects of speed and
gravity on fundamental processes of what we perceive as matter. It is
fundamental in proper operation of satellite based navigation systems,
which rely on atomic clocks for precise timekeeping.
