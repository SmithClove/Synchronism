# Pendulum clock analogy:

Let us consider two identical and synchronized pendulum clocks. We shall
put one in a centrifuge and spin it, while the other remains outside in
normal gravity. When we stop the centrifuge, the clocks will differ by
an easily predictable amount. Does that prove that time dilates in a
centrifuge, or just that the variable we are controlling has a
predictable effect on the instrument we are using to 'measure time'? If
we had a need to accurately keep time in centrifuges by using pendulum
clocks, this 'centrifuge time dilation' would be a useful and reliable
analytical tool for doing so.

As a single-observer model, Synchronism does not invalidate existing
models, nor does it dispute their usefulness and accuracy within
specific MRH and abstraction levels. For example, geocentric astronomy
model with epicycles was very useful and reliable for predicting
apparent positions of celestial bodies, and was relied on for many
centuries of earthbound navigation and study. However geocentric
astronomy would be very inadequate in the MRH of space travel.
