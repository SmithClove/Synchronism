# Speed of light and time dilation in Synchronism:

With that in mind, Synchronism offers a novel perspective on the speed
of light and relativistic effects:

-   The speed of light represents the maximum \"reach\" of a quantum
    cell\'s influence in a single temporal tick.

-   For complex patterns, the probability of intact transition at
    maximum reach decreases with complexity, introducing a probabilistic
    speed limit.

-   As a pattern\'s speed increases, its internal resonances slow down
    relative to the global frame. This occurs because the pattern\'s
    components must \"catch up\" to intent distributions that have
    already shifted.

-   This slowing of internal processes manifests as a decrease in the
    pattern\'s internal frequencies, analogous to relativistic time
    dilation.

This phenomenon can be better understood by revisiting the concept of
coherence introduced in Section 4.7, which outlines the fundamental role
coherence plays in maintaining stable intent patterns.

The above interpretation aligns with experienced relativistic effects
while maintaining synchronism\'s single-observer model and emergent
phenomena framework.

##### 5.7.1 Mathematical Treatment of Speed Limits and Time Dilation

To quantify the concepts of speed limits and time dilation in
Synchronism, we introduce the following mathematical framework:
