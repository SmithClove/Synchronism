# Temperature as Speed of Intent Transfer

Temperature can be conceptualized as the average speed at which intent
patterns transfer within a localized region of space. At the molecular
scale, this speed corresponds to the vibrational and translational
motion of molecules, which are themselves standing waves of intent.

When molecules move faster, the intent patterns they represent transfer
more quickly, increasing temperature. This increase in speed is also
associated with a corresponding increase in frequency, given that the
patterns are localized standing waves. The relationship between
temperature and speed of intent transfer can be expressed as:

T(r, t) ‚àù \<v_intent(r, t)\>

where T(r, t) is the temperature at position r and time t, and
\<v_intent(r, t)\> is the average speed of intent transfer within that
localized region.

This interpretation builds on the foundational principles of intent
transfer discussed in Section 4.3.2, where the mechanics of intent
transfer are laid out.
