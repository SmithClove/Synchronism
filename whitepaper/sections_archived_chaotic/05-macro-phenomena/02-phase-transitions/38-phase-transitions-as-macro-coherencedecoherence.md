# Phase Transitions as Macro Coherence/Decoherence Events

Phase transitions in matter---such as from solid to liquid, liquid to
gas, or gas to plasma---can be understood in Synchronism as macro
coherence or decoherence events. At lower temperatures, molecular
patterns are stable, maintaining strong coherence that manifests as
solid or liquid states. However, as temperature increases, the increased
speed of intent transfer destabilizes these patterns, leading to
decoherence and a shift to less coherent, more dynamic states (such as
gas or plasma).

The threshold at which a phase transition occurs corresponds to a
critical speed of intent transfer, beyond which the existing coherence
cannot be maintained. This results in a reorganization of the intent
patterns, leading to a new emergent behavior that we perceive as a
different phase of matter:

T_crit ≈ (ℏ/k_B) \* ù_intent

Here, T_crit is the critical temperature at which a phase transition
occurs, ℏ is the reduced Planck constant, k_B is Boltzmann\'s constant,
and ù_intent represents the frequency of the intent transfer wave. When
the localized speed exceeds this threshold, the coherence of the
molecular patterns is lost, leading to a phase transition.
