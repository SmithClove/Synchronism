# 5.19.3 Critical Phenomena

Near critical points, the behavior of systems in Synchronism exhibits
universal features:

*Correlation Length: *

The spatial extent of coherent intent patterns diverges near the
critical point:

î(T) = î_0 \|T - T_c\|\^-í

Where î is the correlation length, T_c is the critical temperature, and
í is a critical exponent.

*Critical Slowing Down:*

The relaxation time of intent pattern fluctuations diverges near the
critical point:

ô(T) = ô_0 \|T - T_c\|\^-zí

Where ô is the relaxation time and z is the dynamic critical exponent.

This expanded treatment of temperature and phase transitions in
Synchronism provides a deeper understanding of how macroscopic phenomena
emerge from microscopic intent pattern dynamics, offering new insights
into the nature of matter and its transformations.
