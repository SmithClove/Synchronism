# Energy as Magnitude of Intent Transfer

Energy can be defined as the cumulative effect of intent transfer across
Planck cells over time. Specifically, the energy associated with a
system at a position r and time t can be expressed as:

E(r, t) = Ó\|I_transfer(r, t)\| · Ät

Where \|I_transfer(r, t)\| is the magnitude of intent transfer in a
single tick, Ät is the duration of a tick, and the sum is over N ticks.

This approach links energy directly to the underlying intent dynamics,
providing a common basis for understanding both localized and bulk forms
of energy transfer.
