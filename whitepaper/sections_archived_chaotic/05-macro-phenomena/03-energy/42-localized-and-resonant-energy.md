# Localized and Resonant Energy

At quantum, atomic, and molecular scales, energy often manifests as
localized and resonant intent transfer. Here, energy corresponds to the
frequency and amplitude of these transfers, typically confined to
specific regions or structures.

For instance, the vibrational energy of molecules can be viewed as the
resonant transfer of intent within a localized region:

E_vib(r, t) ∝ ù_intent · A_intent\^2

Where ù_intent is the frequency of the intent transfer and A_intent is
the amplitude.

In such systems, energy is closely tied to the coherence of the
patterns. As long as the patterns remain coherent, energy is conserved
and localized. When decoherence occurs, this localized energy may
dissipate or transform into other forms.
