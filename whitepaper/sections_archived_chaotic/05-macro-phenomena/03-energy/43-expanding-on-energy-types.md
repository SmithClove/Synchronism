# Expanding on Energy Types:

The distinction between localized and bulk energy is crucial for
understanding how energy manifests in different systems. In physical
systems, localized energy corresponds to the potential energy stored in
atomic bonds or the kinetic energy of vibrating molecules. This energy
is highly dependent on the coherence of intent patterns within a
specific region. In contrast, bulk energy, such as the kinetic energy of
a moving mass, is a manifestation of the collective movement of intent
patterns across a larger scale. This form of energy becomes particularly
relevant when considering macroscopic systems, such as planets or stars,
where the motion of mass involves large-scale intent transfers.
