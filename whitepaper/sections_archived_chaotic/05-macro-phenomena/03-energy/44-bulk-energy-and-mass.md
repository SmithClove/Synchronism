# Bulk Energy and Mass

At the macroscopic scale, energy often manifests as bulk movement of
large intent clusters, which we perceive as mass. In Synchronism, mass
is not a fundamental property but an emergent phenomenon resulting from
the collective behavior of intent patterns.

The energy associated with mass can be understood as the total intent
transfer required to maintain the coherence of these clusters as they
move through space:

E_bulk(r, t) = ã · m · c\^2

Where ã is the time dilation factor, m represents the effective mass of
the cluster (the coherent intent), and c is the speed of light,
corresponding to the maximum reach of intent transfer.

This equation parallels E = mc\^2, but in Synchronism, it represents the
energy required to maintain the coherence of a moving intent cluster.
