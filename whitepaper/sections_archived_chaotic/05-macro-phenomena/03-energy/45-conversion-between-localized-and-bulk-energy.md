# Conversion Between Localized and Bulk Energy

Energy can convert between localized (resonant) and bulk forms. This
occurs when localized intent patterns lose coherence (e.g., through
macro-decoherence) and their energy is distributed across a broader
area, or when bulk energy is localized, increasing the resonance of
intent within a specific region.

For example, when a gas condenses into a liquid, the bulk kinetic energy
of the gas molecules is converted into the potential energy of the
liquid\'s molecular bonds, which can be understood as a re-localization
of intent:

E_localized â†” E_bulk

This principle also explains phenomena such as energy release during
phase transitions, where the energy required to maintain coherence in
one state is converted into a different form as the system transitions
to a new state.

By defining energy as the magnitude of intent transfer across Planck
ticks, Synchronism provides a unified framework for understanding energy
in its various forms. Whether manifesting as localized vibrational
energy, bulk kinetic energy, or a combination of both, energy is
fundamentally tied to the dynamics of intent. This perspective aligns
with traditional physical interpretations of energy while offering new
insights into how energy interacts with the underlying fabric of
reality.
