# 5.18.1 Fundamental Definition

Energy in Synchronism is defined as the magnitude of intent transfer
over time:

E(r, t) = Ó\|I_transfer(r, t)\| · Ät

Where E(r, t) is the energy at position r and time t, I_transfer(r, t)
is the magnitude of intent transfer in a single tick, Ät is the duration
of a tick, and the sum is over N ticks.
