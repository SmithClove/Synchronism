# 5.18.2 Forms of Energy

*Kinetic Energy: *

Represents the coherent motion of intent patterns. In bulk matter, this
corresponds to the collective movement of constituent patterns.

*Potential Energy: *

Stored in the tension field configuration, representing the potential
for intent transfer.

*Thermal Energy: *

Manifests as the localized speed and amplitude of intent pattern
oscillations.

*Electromagnetic Energy: *

Emerges from the resonant patterns of intent associated with electric
and magnetic fields.
