# 5.18.3 Energy Conservation and Transformation

The principle of energy conservation in Synchronism states that the
total magnitude of intent transfer within a closed system remains
constant. Energy transformations involve changes in the form or scale of
intent pattern interactions:

*Work: *

The transfer of energy through the application of force, represented by
changes in the tension field configuration.

*Heat Transfer: *

The flow of thermal energy between systems, corresponding to the
equalization of intent pattern oscillation speeds.

*Radiative Transfer: *

The emission or absorption of electromagnetic energy, involving the
creation or absorption of resonant electromagnetic intent patterns.
