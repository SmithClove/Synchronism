# Catalysis

Catalysts, in the Synchronism view, act as intent transfer mediators.
They provide alternative pathways for intent patterns to reorganize,
effectively lowering the activation energy for reactions. This can be
visualized as the catalyst creating a resonant bridge between the intent
patterns of reactants, facilitating their transformation into products.
