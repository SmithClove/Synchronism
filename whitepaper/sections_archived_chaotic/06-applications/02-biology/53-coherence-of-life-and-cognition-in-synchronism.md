# 13 Coherence of Life and Cognition in Synchronism

Within the Synchronism framework, biological life and cognitive
processes represent highly complex, coherent patterns of intent. These
patterns are intricately balanced, relying on precise ranges of
temperature and energy to maintain their stability. This section
explores how the coherence of these patterns is confined to a narrow
range of conditions and how they are particularly vulnerable to
decoherence under extreme circumstances, such as high-speed travel.
