# Cognitive Coherence and Its Fragility

Cognitive processes, which represent even more complex and dynamic
intent patterns, are particularly sensitive to changes in temperature
and energy. These processes depend on the highly coherent transfer of
intent across neural networks, where any disruption can lead to
significant loss of function.

The relationship between cognitive coherence and high-speed travel
discussed here is closely related to the principles outlined in Section
5.7: Speed Limits and Time Dilation, where the impact of velocity on
coherence is explored.

In Synchronism, cognitive coherence is modeled as a high-frequency,
resonant interaction of the brain\'s neural patterns. Because these
patterns operate at the limits of coherence, they are prone to decohere
under extreme conditions, such as high temperature, intense
gravitational fields, or high-speed travel.

ë_cognition ∝ T \* (ù_cognition / ù_intent)

Here, ë_cognition represents the cognitive decoherence rate, which
increases as temperature deviates from the optimal range or as the
frequency of intent transfer becomes misaligned with the cognitive
process frequency ù_cognition.
