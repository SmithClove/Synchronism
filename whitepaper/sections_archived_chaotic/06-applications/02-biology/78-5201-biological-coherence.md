# 5.20.1 Biological Coherence

Living systems in Synchronism are characterized by their ability to
maintain highly coherent intent pattern interactions within a narrow
range of conditions.

*Optimal Temperature: *

The temperature range conducive to biological coherence is given by:

T_optimal ≈ (ℏ/k_B) \* ù_intent

Where ù_intent represents the characteristic frequency of biological
intent patterns.

*Biological Coherence Function: *

We can define a coherence function for living systems:

C_bio(r, t, T) = exp(-\|ø_life(r, t, T) - ø_equilibrium\|\^2 / ó\^2)

Where ø_life represents the intent pattern of the living system,
ø_equilibrium is the equilibrium intent pattern, and ó is a parameter
determining the sensitivity of coherence.
