# Cosmological Implications:

In cosmology, the Synchronism model might offer new insights into the
behavior of complex structures, such as galaxies or black holes, as they
interact with the fabric of space-time. The probabilistic nature of
transitions could help explain phenomena such as the apparent stability
of certain cosmic structures or the experienced discrepancies in
high-velocity astronomical objects.
