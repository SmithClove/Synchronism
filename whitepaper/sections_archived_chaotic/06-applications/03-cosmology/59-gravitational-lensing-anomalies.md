# Gravitational Lensing Anomalies

**Observation:** Gravitational lensing, the bending of light around
massive objects, often reveals effects stronger than can be accounted
for by visible matter alone. These anomalies suggest the presence of
additional, unseen mass.

**Synchronism Interpretation:** If black holes are considered a form of
dark matter within the Synchronism framework, these lensing anomalies
could be explained by the presence of black holes or similar
gravitational entities that are not directly observable. The interaction
between these dark entities and regular matter through the universal
tension field manifests as gravitational lensing, providing indirect
evidence of their existence.
