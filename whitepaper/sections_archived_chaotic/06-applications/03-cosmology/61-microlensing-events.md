# Microlensing Events

**Observation:** Microlensing, the temporary magnification of distant
starlight, has revealed events that cannot be explained by known
objects, hinting at the presence of dark matter.

**Synchronism Interpretation:** These unexplained microlensing events
could be attributed to small black holes or other gravitational entities
within the dark matter spectrum. Synchronism posits that such entities,
while not visible, are detectable through their gravitational influence,
resonating with the idea that black holes and dark matter are
fundamentally linked.
