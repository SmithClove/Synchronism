# Supermassive Black Holes and Dark Matter Halos

**Observation:** A correlation exists between the mass of supermassive
black holes at the centers of galaxies and the properties of surrounding
dark matter halos, but the nature of this relationship is not well
understood.

**Synchronism Interpretation:** Within the Synchronism framework, this
relationship could be explained by the gravitational interactions
between black holes and dark matter, both being manifestations of the
tension field. The dynamics of this interaction might shape the
structure and evolution of galaxies, with black holes influencing the
distribution of dark matter and vice versa.
