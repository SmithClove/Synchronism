# 5.17.1 Core Principles

*Universal Tension Field: *

All fields, including electromagnetic fields, are manifestations of the
underlying tension field arising from the distribution and flow of
intent.

*Emergent Properties: *

Electromagnetic phenomena emerge from specific resonant patterns of
intent within the tension field

*Intent Transfer and Coherence: *

The dynamics of intent transfer and coherence shape these emergent
patterns and their interactions.
