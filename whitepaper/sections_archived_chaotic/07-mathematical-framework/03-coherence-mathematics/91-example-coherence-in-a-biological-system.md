# Example: Coherence in a Biological System

To illustrate the coherence function in a biological context, consider a
network of neurons in the brain. Each neuron can be represented as a
node in a grid, where the intent within each cell corresponds to the
level of electrical activity or \"firing rate\" of the neuron. The
tension field T(r,t) in this case represents the gradient of neural
activity across the network.

The coherence function C(r,t) quantifies the alignment of activity
within a local neighborhood of neurons. For instance, if neighboring
neurons are firing in a synchronized manner, the coherence function will
yield a high value, indicating a stable and coherent pattern of neural
activity. Conversely, if the neurons are firing at different rates or
are out of sync, the coherence value will be low, signaling a less
stable pattern.

This concept is crucial for understanding phenomena such as neural
synchrony, where coherent patterns of firing across neurons are
associated with specific cognitive states, such as attention or
consciousness.
