# Order Parameter

We introduce an order parameter รถ(r,t) representing the degree of
coherence in the system:

รถ(r,t) = F\[T(r,t)\]

where F is a functional that maps the tension field to the order
parameter.

The order parameter, รถ(r,t), serves as a quantitative measure of
coherence within the Synchronism model. It reflects the degree to which
an entity or pattern \"exists\" by quantifying the alignment and
coordination of intent within its constituent cells. A high order
parameter signifies a stable, well-defined entity, while a low order
parameter suggests a transient or dissipating pattern. The order
parameter, therefore, can be seen as a bridge between the abstract
concept of \"existence\" and its concrete manifestation in the dynamics
of intent distribution. It offers a potential tool for predicting the
stability and lifespan of emergent patterns, opening new avenues for
understanding the complex interplay between coherence and existence in
the universe.
