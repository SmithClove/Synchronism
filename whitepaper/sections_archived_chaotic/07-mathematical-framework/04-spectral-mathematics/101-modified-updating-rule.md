# Modified Updating Rule:

We modify the updating rule for intent to incorporate time dilation:

I(r,t + Ät) = I(r,t) + ÓT(r,t)·Ät/ã(r,t) + á·C(r,t)·Ät/ã(r,t)

This framework quantifies how increasing velocity affects the
probability of pattern transition and slows internal processes,
consistent with relativistic time dilation while maintaining the
principles of Synchronism.
