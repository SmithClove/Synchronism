# Velocity and Complexity:

In the Synchronism framework, the complexity function C(r,t) represents
the intricacy and interconnectedness of a pattern\'s internal structure.
This complexity can arise from various factors, such as the number of
constituent elements within the pattern, the degree of interdependence
between these elements, and the overall stability of the pattern\'s
internal dynamics.

Let v(r,t) be the velocity vector of a pattern at position r and time t.
We define a complexity function C(r,t) that quantifies the intricacy of
a pattern:

C(r,t) = f(I(r,t), ∇I(r,t))

where I(r,t) is the intent field and ∇I(r,t) is its spatial gradient.
