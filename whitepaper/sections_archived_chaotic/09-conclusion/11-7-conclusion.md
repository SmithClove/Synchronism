# 7. Conclusion

Synchronism presents a comprehensive model of reality that seeks to unify diverse perspectives 
and provide a broader understanding of the universe. By offering alternative explanations for 
experienced phenomena and introducing new concepts for analysis, it invites further exploration 
and refinement of our understanding of existence. 
Key aspects of Synchronism's contribution include: 
• 
Unified Framework: It provides a conceptual framework that attempts to bridge 
scientific, philosophical, and spiritual understandings of reality. 
• 
Multi-scale Perspective: The model encourages consideration of phenomena at multiple 
scales, from the quantum to the cosmic, potentially revealing new connections and 
insights. 
• 
Reinterpretation of Fundamental Concepts: By reframing concepts like space, time, 
energy, and matter in terms of intent distribution and transfer, Synchronism offers fresh 
perspectives on the nature of reality. 
• 
New Approaches to Inquiry: The model suggests novel methods for studying complex 
systems and emergent phenomena, potentially opening new avenues for scientific and 
philosophical investigation. 
• 
Ethical and Existential Implications: Synchronism raises important questions about free 
will, consciousness, interconnectedness, and human responsibility, potentially 
influencing ethical frameworks and existential understanding. 
• 
Abstraction and Multi-Scale Analysis: The introduction of abstraction as a formal tool 
within synchronism enhances its applicability across various domains and scales of 
inquiry. It provides a practical means to navigate the complexities of multi-scale 
phenomena while maintaining the holistic perspective that is central to the synchronism 
framework. 
• 
Interdisciplinary Integration: The broad scope of the model encourages integration of 
insights from diverse fields, promoting a more holistic approach to knowledge. 
While Synchronism is a speculative model that requires further development and empirical 
validation, it offers a thought-provoking framework for reconsidering our understanding of the 
universe and our place within it. As with any comprehensive model of reality, it should be 
approached with both open-mindedness and critical thinking, serving as a catalyst for further 
inquiry and exploration rather than a definitive explanation of existence. 
The ongoing development and refinement of Synchronism may contribute to advancing our 
collective understanding of reality, fostering dialogue between different disciplines, and inspiring 
new approaches to some of the most fundamental questions facing humanity. 

Glossary of Key Terms in Synchronism 
Intent: A reification of the abstract "greater force" proposed by various belief systems. It serves 
as a quantifiable and analyzable representation in Synchronism, bridging abstract concepts with 
concrete phenomena. (See Section 4.3.1) 
Planck Cell: Discrete unit of space in the Synchronism grid, sized at the Planck length. (See 
Section 4.1) 
Tick: Smallest unit of time in Synchronism, equivalent to Planck time. (See Section 4.2) 
Slice: Complete state of the universe at a specific tick. (See Section 4.2) 
Tension: The potential for intent transfer between cells, influenced by neighboring cells' intent 
levels. (See Section 4.3.2) 
Intent Saturation: The state in which a cell reaches its maximum intent level. A saturated cell 
cannot accept additional intent from neighboring cells, effectively creating a barrier to intent 
transfer and contributing to formation of entities. (See Section 4.3.3) 
Reach: The maximum distance a cell's intent can influence in a single tick, related to the speed 
of light. (See Section 5.7) 
Entity: A stable, coherent pattern of intent distribution on a specific fractal scale that persists over 
multiple ticks. Entities can range from subatomic particles to complex organisms and even larger 
cosmic structures, each defined by its unique, recurring pattern of intent. (See Section 4.4) 
Emergence: The process by which complex patterns and entities arise from simple interactions. 
(See Section 4.4) 
Resonance: Constructive interaction between fractal peer entities, reinforcing their existence. 
(See Section 4.6.1) 
Dissonance: Destructive interaction between fractal peer entities, weakening their existence. (See 
Section 4.6.2) 
Coherence: Resonance across fractal boundaries, serving as a key mechanism of emergence. It 
represents the degree to which individual constituent fractal components of an entity are 
influenced by their group behavior as an entity, and vice versa. (See Section 4.7.1) 
Macro-decoherence: The breakdown of coherence in complex patterns under extreme 
conditions. (See Section 5.7.3) 
Markov Blanket: A boundary defining an entity's separation from its environment in terms of 
information flow. (See Section 4.8) 

Markov Relevancy Horizon: The fractal, spatial, and temporal boundary beyond which 
additional information doesn't significantly improve a model's predictive power. (See Section 4.9) 
Abstraction: The process in synchronism of simplifying complex systems by representing 
information from scales outside the Markov relevancy horizon in forms that are meaningful and 
useful for the chosen scale of analysis. (See Section 4.11) 
The Observer: The Observer is the singular, unifying perspective from which the entire 
model is built. It's an abstract concept representing the overarching consciousness or 
framework within which all phenomena and interactions occur. The Observer's 
perspective is absolute and unchanging, providing a consistent reference point for 
understanding the evolution of the universe. 
Witness: A witness is any entity within the universe, at any scale, that experiences 
interactions with other entities within its Markov Relevancy Horizon (MRH). The existence 
of a witness is defined by its experiences and interactions. Unlike the Observer, a witness 
has a limited and subjective perspective, shaped by its specific position and interactions 
within the universe. 
In essence, the Observer represents the ultimate, all-encompassing perspective, while witnesses 
are the individual entities that experience and interact within the framework defined by the 
Observer. The Observer's perspective is objective and unchanging, while the witness's 
perspective is subjective and dynamic, evolving based on its interactions and experiences.
