# 20 Limitations and Assumptions

The mathematical framework presented in this appendix is based on
several key assumptions:

-   The discretization of space and time into Planck-scale units.

-   The applicability of classical mathematical tools (e.g., tensor
    calculus, Fourier analysis) to quantum-scale phenomena.

-   The validity of extending quantum concepts to macroscopic scales.

These assumptions, while necessary for the development of the model, may
limit its applicability in certain extreme conditions or at the
boundaries between quantum and classical regimes. Further refinement of
these mathematical constructs may be necessary as the Synchronism model
evolves.
