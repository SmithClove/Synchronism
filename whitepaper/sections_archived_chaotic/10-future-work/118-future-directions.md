# 21 Future Directions

Future mathematical developments in Synchronism could include:

-   More rigorous formulation of the relationship between coherence and
    emergence across scales.

-   Integration of concepts from quantum field theory to refine the
    treatment of intent fields.

-   Development of computational models to simulate complex Synchronism
    scenarios.

-   Exploration of potential experimental setups to test the predictions
    of these mathematical formulations.
