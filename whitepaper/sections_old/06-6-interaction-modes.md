# 6 Interaction Modes

In the Synchronism model, entities (which are patterns of intent
distribution) can interact with each other in three primary modes. These
interaction modes describe how different patterns influence each other
and contribute to the overall dynamics of the universe.

The three interaction modes are:

##### 4.6.1 Resonance

-   Entities reinforce each other\'s existence through aligned intent
    distributions.

-   Resonant interactions lead to stronger, more stable patterns.

-   This mode can be seen as a form of constructive interference, where
    aligned patterns amplify each other.

##### 4.6.2 Dissonance

-   Entities weaken each other\'s existence through misaligned intent
    distributions.

-   Dissonant interactions lead to the destabilization or breakdown of
    patterns.

-   This mode can be seen as a form of destructive interference, where
    misaligned patterns diminish each other.

##### 4.6.3 Indifference

-   Entities do not interact and are effectively non-existent to each
    other.

-   Indifferent entities operate in separate intent distribution spaces,
    with no meaningful exchange of intent between them.

-   This mode represents a lack of interaction or influence between
    patterns.

These interaction modes provide a framework for understanding how
different entities or patterns in the universe influence each other,
leading to the complex dynamics experienced in nature.
