# 5.19.1 Temperature

Temperature in Synchronism is proportional to the localized speed of
intent pattern transfer at the molecular scale:

T(r, t) = k_T Â· \<v_intent(r, t)\>

Where T(r, t) is the temperature at position r and time t, \<v_intent(r,
t)\> is the average speed of intent transfer within that localized
region, and k_T is a proportionality constant that connects temperature
to the speed of intent transfer.
